       "'/start/Atmosphere:\\nTokyo Story is a Japanese drama film directed by Yasujiro Ozu, which was released in 1953. The film follows an aging couple who travel to Tokyo to visit their grown children, only to find that their children are too busy with their own lives to pay much attention to them. The atmosphere of the film is melancholic, introspective and nostalgic. It explores themes of aging, family, and the changing relationships between generations in post-war Japan. The film is known for its delicate and understated style, and its keen insight into the human experience.\\n/end/Atmosphere\\n/start/Tags:\\nJapanese drama, aging, family, relationships, post-war Japan, melancholic, introspective, nostalgic.\\n/end/Tags\\n/start/RecommensationsGame:\\nNone.\\n/end/RecommensationsGame\\n/start/RecommensationsBook:\\n\"The Housekeeper and the Professor\" by Yoko Ogawa, \"Norwegian Wood\" by Haruki Murakami, \"Kitchen\" by Banana Yoshimoto.\\n/end/RecommensationsBook'"
