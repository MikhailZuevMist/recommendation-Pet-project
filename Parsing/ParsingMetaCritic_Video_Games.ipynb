       "'Spider-Man 2 may be called a comic book movie, but is so much more than that. The film improves the action thanks to a larger budget, has awesome acting and characters, and an excellent script which has a heart and entertains. Spider-Man 2 is a movie you truly have to see to believe, it is the master of comic book movies along with The Dark Knight. Even if you are not a Spider-Man fan, SEE THIS MOVIE!. Spider-Man 2 is some of the most fun I have had during a movie. It is much more than a comic book movie and the character development in this movie is just great. I cared much more for the characters in this movie than Spider-Man (2002). The action sequences are brilliant in this movie, especially the train battle between our friendly-neighborhood Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus. Mary Jane is a forceful character in this movie though and by that, I mean, we are forced to like her as a character. She wasn\\'t nearly as charming as Emma Stone was in The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) but this still is and will be, at least for a while i believe, the first movie which pops into my head when I think of \"Spider-Man.\". Sequels are always common ground for big franchise and surprise hits in the film world, but they don’t always succeed, actors may not want to return, drastic changes are often made which hampers the success of the original and they never really come up as strong, but this is not the case whatsoever with Spider-Man 2, a film which gets everything right, it has a real story, an emotional journey of self-esteem and the tests that face relationships and friendship when people are clouded by uncontrollable rage.Tobey Maguire puts in much more personal performance in his second outing as the now conflicted web slinger, unable to juggle his crime fighting alter-ego and his attempt at an ordinary life of college and living alone. We see a world around him that doesn’t appreciate the pizza delivery man and the one behind the mask, branded an outlaw as Spider-Man and a slacking student as Peter Parker, his hard life reflects is superpowers too, which begin to fade in and out as his troubles worsen. The film is a dark and personal story which is such a triumph as the film goes along, we have another villain in the form of Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), a genius scientist who is attempting to create free energy, but a disastrous accident sends the man insane, now pursuing the person he sees responsible, Spider-Man.The film cleverly explores each avenue of problematic issues with having a dual lifestyle.Peter sees everyone he loves drifting away from him, we see a touching performance from Rosemary Harris playing Aunt May, a stubborn woman who fends for herself, and we see a different side to the woman when Peter reveals the truth about the tragic death of Uncle Ben in the first film, the continuity continues to flow throughout the film, calling back previous plots helps stay involved. We also have one of the most visually spectacular films to date, with various scenes including stopping a train, catapulting from one building to the next and a very explosive finale that hits the right buttons each and every turn, with excellent scenes that leave you in awe, that is sure to leave everyone satisfied.One of the best sequels ever made, and certainly one of the best superhero films to date, it is hard-hitting, personal, beautiful and very character-driven that it works as both an action epic and a dramatic story, the superhero film that has always been desired.. The perfect sequel and the best Spider-Man movie that has ever been made. The movie is just excellent and Alfred Molina is the greatest Spider-Man villain of all as he plays Doctor Octopus.. Second Spidey film, man builds extra arms, get out of control, becomes evil, Spiderman loses his powers & his girl, can he get them back?Bigger in everyway than the very entertaining first & maybe a bit too much CGI rather than story. However, still a very good watch. Tobey Maguire is perfect in the role as is the very under-rated J.K Simmons (I love him in Juno).Sort of on par with the first but for different reasons.. a great follow-up to Spiderman. i loved this movie from start to finish.  it captured spider man in his fullest.  this was almost like the comic book.   it was great.   this movie was incredible.  the train scene was unbelievable.  this was way better than spider man 3.  its the best spider man movie.   near perfect. Spider-man 2 is the perfect comic book movie, quite possibly the best ever made up until this time. It\\'s a movie with character, love, and life, and prior to what you might think it\\'s not really a movie about killing bad guys at all...it\\'s a beautiful love story. Wonderously acted, funny, witty, smart, it hits all the right notes. There are scenes in this movie that just make you smile with pure joy like, \"I can\\'t believe they did that!\" but oh they do, from Spider-man losing grip on his powers, to losing friends and gaining enemies, to accepting the fact that he shouldn\\'t be the web slinger any longer (*hint\" the \"rain drops  keep fallin\\' on my head\" sequence was perfection). Everything about Spider-man 2 shows a flawed character trying to live his own life. Toby Maguire\\'s Peter Parker is a character we can all relate to. Whether he\\'s struggling with old demons from the past, working with love all the while dealing with criminals on a daily basis, trying to make his own life by going to school and working, and dealing with, quite possibly, the most legendary and sinister Spider-man villain of all time. Anytime you think you\\'ve got it hard take a step into this man\\'s life and you\\'ll witness hard. The movie is sad, joyful, funny, loving, and full of life! It feels like a movie actually touched by human hands. It seems Sam Raimi\\'s main focus was character development, an excellent story, excellent perfomances, and character. All which are nailed all too perfectly. But this does not take away from the action, which is beautifully shot, fantastically created, and perfectly executed. The action in this flick will keep you on the edge of your seat and keep you chearing, it\\'s a modern epic, and what a sure super hero film should be all about.. This is even better than the original! The acting is still up to scratch, the visual effects are much improved and it has a deep emotional focus that never goes insipid at any point. Alfred Molina as Doc Ock HAS to be one of the greatest villains of all time. It\\'s less cheesy than the first, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not cheesy at all. Still, nonetheless, this and The Dark Knight are the best superhero sequels of all time.. Spider-Man 2 and Sam Raimi take the video game approach to sequels and I say this in the best possible way. All he really does is take what he did so well in the first one and build on it, with a snazzy new villain (played to perfection by Alfred Molina), subtle progression of the main characters and overall a story that is about as fun (if not more so) as the first film. Its a great popcorn film with some thrilling set pieces (especially the segments involving the train). It isn\\'t timeless (I don\\'t know a superhero movie that is) but its great, really great. Peter Parkers journey seems realistic in its progression (given the whole radioactive spider of it all) with the relationships between the characters being the main draw of the film despite the brilliant action. The dynamic between Peter and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) or Peter and his aunt are engaging with the latter bringing some serious emotions out that had been stored up since the first film. Its a great next step in a story I think will only get better.........oh wait its Eddie Brock.. After a long break, from writing reviews for movies, I\\'ve decided to start out with Spider-Man 2. Spider-Man 2, the best in the series. I\\'ve just finished seeing it, for like the 3rd time. There are not a lot of movie sequel that improve the non-sequel version. Spider-Man 2 is definitely not in that category. Even though I was really impressed about Spider-Man back in 2002, when it broke all records, Spider-Man 2 raise up to its level and in some areas even surpassed it. I\\'m not going to give you any spoilers on the movie, not really my style. But I will say this, the story line, the characters raise up to their full potential. It\\'s not just action followed by more action, its something more, it impresses in every area of movies. Breathtaking moments, action packed fights, great development in the story, everything to make you see at least once...So, hope you enjoyed :) my personal opinion on 2004\\'s Spider-Man 2. (10/10). This film goes far beyond just a superhero movie, in fact, it can be called a movie treasure. Spider-Man 2 improves tremendously over its predecessor with a storyline that immerses the audience on a deep emotional level, supplies plenty of good humor, and brings a fan favorite villain to life in an exciting fashion. Not only is Spider-Man 2 the perfect superhero movie, but it\\'s also the set standard on how a great movie should be made in the first place. This also happens to be my favorite superhero movie, and one of my favorite movies of all time, with an entertainment value for ages to come.. The best way to describe this Spider-Man: More action and more fleshed-out characters. Doc Ock was a great choice for the villain and Tobey Maguire is great here.. Rarely does a sequel come along that it better than the already-great first movie, with more action and a better story. But screw movie logic, Spider-Man 2 does it anyway.. This was a great movie and my second favorite Marvel movie next to Iron Man! This was the only Marvel movie I\\'ve ever seen where I\\'ve actually liked the ending! I can\\'t say anymore than that without spoiling something so Nuff\\' said!. What can be said about \"Spider-Man 2\" that hasn\\'t been said yet? Well, opss! It has already been said: It\\'s the best Spider-Man movie to date. Everything from the deeply emotional relationship between Peter and Aunt May to the mind-blowing action is a delight watching. Full review soon. :D. Easily the greatest Spider-Man movie ever created in the history of ever. Seriously, go see this movie. Everything about this movie is absolutely perfect, I cannot imagine a greater superhero movie. A combination of an all-star cast, perfect acting, and action scenes that will rock your socks make this the greatest super-hero ever made, and the greatest superhero movie that will ever be made. Except for maybe X-Men: Days of Future Past, which blows this movie right out of the water. Seriously, go see X-Men: Days of Future Past. It is literally a perfect movie.. One of the best superhero movies ever and the best Spider-Man movies ever,with one of the best villains ever: Otto Octavius alias Doctor Octopus.An epic movie.. Most relatable superhero ever. And one of the best protagonist of all time.. Spiderman 2 is not only better than the first but it succeeds expectations from its time and holds up very well. Spiderman 2 is still easily a masterpiece and is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best superhero movies ever made right up there with TDK and Infinity War. The action is a major improvement as the train scene is still not only the best action scene in any Spiderman movie but is one of the greatest action scenes in any comic-book movie. The acting again from everyone is solid. Doctor Octopus was a fantastic villain that taught many themes and lessons that can be used in the real world and the way he sacrificed himself to save the world was very well done. Again just like the first, the directing is very good and the music is perfect for conveying emotion. Finally Spiderman 2 features one of the greatest stories in any comic-book movie as the Spiderman No more arc in my opinion is the best part of the film. It really fleshed out Peter Parker and makes him a very likable and relatable protagonist. I do have one problem with this movie and it is that MJ can be a very unlikeable character at times but overall I didn\\'t think she was that bad. Anyways very good movie and it for sure deserves a 10/10.. Great movie, great and interesting history, the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane is good, good action scenes, the film shows the problems and responsibilities of Peter Parker, shows that it is not a super invincible hero.. La mejor película de Super Héroes de todos los tiempos. Spider-Man 2 es mejor que su antecesora en todos los aspectos, los efectos especiales son increíbles, las actuaciones siguen siendo excelentes y sobre todo, Alfred Molina ofrece un excelente villano y de lejos uno de los mejores vistos en cine. La historia de esta segunda parte es asombrosa, divertida y dramática a la vez , violenta y oscura sin dudarlo, pero sobre todo, ofrece un mensaje único y conmovedor. Ah, olvide mencionar que esta película tiene una de las mejores secuencias de acción que eh visto en mucho tiempo, la escena de Spider-Man VS Doctor Octopus en el tren es épica, brillante y emocionante. Repito: Es la mejor película de Super Héroes que eh visto en mucho tiempo, si hacemos un TOP, detrás de Spider-Man 2 le sigue Iron Man y Ant Man. el hombre araña 2 es un 100% maravilla  aun mejor que su procesedor y una de las majores peliculas de marvel comics basadas en spiderman junto a su precuela. This is obviously one of the most memorable movie during my childhood. I watch both 2 and 2.1 and the plot was just so damn good, it gave you extreme pulse racing visuals that really let you see through his eyes, Spider Man\\'s personality is one anyone can literally become apart of. The action scenes are actually very realistic, I enjoyed that the producers actually put Peter in realistic situations that just always pushed the limits of his possibilities.This film made him one of my favorite super heroes, I wish they used this same type of creativity in the new films.. One Of The Best Superhero Movies Ever MadeSpider-Man 2 isn’t only better than it\\'s predecessor, It’s one of the best Superhero movies ever made.. This is the real Spider-man ! Not Homecoming !Every aspect of the movie is on point,just like the 1st one!. You\\'re not a real Spider-Man fan if you haven\\'t watched this. I\\'m a true fan and I\\'ve watched it more than 10 times .... Sequels usually have this thing where they end up being total garbage compared to the first, but surprisingly, Spider Man 2 was on point. Same quality, same amazing plot, and same award-winning performance by Tobey Maguire.. Definitely a fan\\'s dream-come-true! Studios of today should take notes from films like this if they want to produce a successful superhero film.. One of the best super hero movies ever made. The first movie was great, but somehow this movie is better in every way possible. A better villain, better action, better choreography, and more emotional story make this the ultimate viewing of your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man.. Best Spider-Man movie,one of the pioneers of today\\'s superhero movies.The action scenes are amazing and the villain (Doc Oc) is the best thing on the movie. Most overrated superhero movie in existence. This movie does not hold up at all.. Spider-Man 3 is the Lawrence Of Arabia of the superhero movies world. It is epic, sprawling, magnificent, meaningful, beautiful. Anyone who doesn\\'t enjoy this movie must be a pretty spoilt brat or a cynical old misery. For near on three hours it envelops you in its world and makes you CARE about the characters. How\\'s that for a special effects laden blockbuster, a movie with characters that matter? The comedy works, the emotion works, the action works. Everything Raimi tries comes off. The set pieces are particularly astounding, ranging from an out of control crane to Spidey\\'s numerous battles with the meaty villains on show. Like others, I think this is by far the best of the three (though I loved the first two as well). It\\'s a modern-day classic, an enrapturing fantasy that exhibits all that\\'s best in modern movie making. An experience not to be missed.. This film is a masterpiece. If you don\\'t believe it, ask these critics and IMDB fans alike. The division is what creates brilliance. Heck, there was even division among Bobby and Babel, and even among Queen. This film is certainly better than the first two (with Babel being like \"Crash\" the lite version), and is on a par with Queen. This film is a masterpiece. Just go ask IMDB fans.. In my opinion one of the best superhero films ever, has excellent visuals, writing, story, acting and music.. Spider-Man 2 improves upon the original in every possible way. It\\'s truly a sequel that not only rivals but I feel even tops the original and that is such a rare thing nowadays.. A deeper movie than the first, not just about the cool action sequences, but about life, love, loss, and grief. The sequel outshines the original movie, which focused on the beginning, while in \\'Spider Man 2\\', the pathos is more pragmatic and conveys some emotion, which few action movies do. The acting, specifically the complexity of Alfred Molina, is natural and doesn\\'t come off as blatantly campy. The effects are cool, the direction is spot on. Hardly anything to complain about.. This may be a very personal opinion, but I think \"Spider-Man 2\" is the best superhero film ever made, so far. It\\'s slightly superior to the original on every way.  Also, Doctor Octopus as a villain, he\\'s the best. And, if there\\'s one character more important or better than Spider-Man himself, that\\'s Peter Parker. You get to know Peter\\'s feelings and personal troubles so well that by the end of the film you end up caring not only for him, but also for his family, friends and acquaintances. And that is the definition of a perfect movie.. While this the first one had a light tone and an emphasis on fun, this movie was able to surpass the first one in quality and enjoyment while having a much darker and serious tone. The cast still does a fantastic job and Dr. Octopus is the best Marvel villain to date. His character is incredibly well developed, emotionally resonant and interesting. The story is very coherent, thrilling and heartfelt. This movie is a superhero film masterpiece. Every single aspect of this movie, every beat, every character, every action scene, every CG effect and every story arc is perfectly on point and how it should be. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film, a gloriously smart blockbuster by Sam Raimi. The best Marvel movie ever.. Spiderman 2 is my favourite comic book film mainly because the performances are top notch the story is intriguing the action is exhilarating the characters are very well fleshed out ugh I love this movie!!!.. Still the greatest Spider-Man movie to date. Filled with great action, heart, emotion and a complex story that really does make you feel for Peter. The movie does suffer from poor dialogue between MJ and Peter. This movie has one of the greatest action sequences in a comic book movie, the Train sequence. 8.5/10. The Godfather II of Superhero movies. The action scenes are so complex and spectacular. Tobey Maguire is brilliant as Peter Parker, who goes through his most challenging character arc yet. Molina steals every scene he\\'s in as Doc Oc. Didn\\'t get a 10 because some of the cgi dates the film.. Removing some moments that are ridiculous nowadays, Spider-Man 2 stands as the best spiderman movie and one of the best superhero movies.. Spider-Man 2 is one of my favorite films of all time and is the first movie I saw in theaters. This is a film that feels much more than a comic book movie, it\\'s characters are much more fleshed out the film has a great villain, Alfred Molina nailed his performance as Doctor Octopus, J.K Simmons back as J. Jonah Jameson, and for me this film feels like it has the most polished directing in the Trilogy. And this film has some of my favorite action set pieces in any comic book movies especially that Train Scene and the hospital scene this film also has some great comedic moments. This again I agree with being on of the greatest comic book movies along with The Dark Knight and Logan. This film with it\\'s many great action moments and great comedic moments is fun, I recommend that you go and see this film right now, you\\'re gonna have a great time. Perfection. All around a huge improvement on the already great first entry in the series. The definitive Spider-Man movie including one of the best Marvel villains ever put on screen.  Amazing movie.. Spider-Man 2 is the Best Spider-Man Movie Ever, It Has Perfect Visual Effects and CGI, One of the Best Villains in Movie History, The Best Fight Sequence in Any Movie, and a Well Told Story, Spider-Man is the 2nd Best Superhero Movie Ever.. This is a classic, definitely my favorite Sam Raimi Spider-Man movie, better than the first in every way possible, more action, better characters and pretty good writing.. An incredible movie and must see for any superheroes fan and still to this day (2019), the greatest superhero film I’ve seen to date. It put me close to tears at how such an amazing film came out of a superhero I have zero F’s about. It isn’t just mindless action like these other superhero films of that time and now, all these characters have deep motives and understandable ideologies with some straight up heart-touching performances.This holds the golden standard of how a superhero film should be and strive to be. None of these MCU films have even come close and certainly not that homecoming movie.. Spider-Man 1 was already amazing, but Raimi blew Spider-Man 1 out of the water with this movie. This movie has a lot more emotional scenes, improved action scenes and the special effects hold up to this day. I am not afraid to say that this is one of the best movies ever made.. It was amazing to see what they did to Harry\\'s character. He went from being Peter\\'s best friend to mortal enemy. I can\\'t blame him though cause what do you expect would happen if you found out your best friend was the one who killed your father?. To me, it felt like what Uncle Ben imparted to Peter in the first film - with great power comes great responsibility - was the very essence of this film. He had too much power, too much responsibility, and he needed to find a way to balance all of that.. This is one of the OG films that paved the way for the superhero films of today. I can\\'t express how thankful I am for Tobey Maguire for being the pioneer!. If you ask me, this is leaps and bounds better than the Superhero films - even the Batman films. Spider-Man is that person anyone can relate to. He has such a big human side to him that it\\'s hard not to resonate with him.. More than just a comic book hero, Spider Man is a person with human problems, responsibilities, and the same human struggles each of us go through. This is exactly the reason why a lot of people like him so much.. Rather than trying to top the first film, Spider Man 2 builds upon each of the elements of it. Better fight scenes, better effects, better script, better acting, etc.. Spider Man 2 has it all - a great story line, action that\\'ll leave you at the edge of your seats, more romance, humor, fine acting, and excellent pacing.. One of the nearly-flawless superhero movies we have and is a definite must-watch for all generations.. Full of action, plenty of adventure, and  even with the technology back then, this still has award winning special effects for its time.. Spider-man 2 is honestly the best Spider-man movie in this trilogy. Actually no scrap that, it\\'s honestly the best Spider-Man movie to this day.. Personally out of the three Spider-Man movies in Sam Raimi\\'s trilogy, this is the one I was the least interested in. It wasn\\'t introducing Spider-Man for the first time like Spider-Man 1, nor did it have all the villains I knew like Spider-Man 3. In fact I didn\\'t even knew who Doctor Octopus was before watching this movie. And seeing him as a fat man with tentacles didn\\'t help either. So I had watched it from a reluctant point of view, only to start liking it by the end.In the beginning it is established that no matter how many powers Peter gets, it won\\'t change the fact that people still see him as a nerd, which is something that happens in the comics too. And this time he has a lot more interaction with his best friend Harry. They are shown to be really good friends, until it is revealed that Spider-Man was the one who killed his father. And instead of justifying that Green Goblin died of his own fault, Peter didn\\'t make any excuses and just told Harry that there are more important matters to attend. This shows how Spider-Man understands his responsibilities as a superhero, something that Uncle Ben had taught him very well before his death.Later on Peter is completely depressed and he loses all his superpowers. He embraces back to his nerd self, but doesn\\'t hesitate from playing hero again when he sees a building on fire. He can\\'t see anyone suffering any longer now that he has played a hero for so long. This is also established when he sees a couple of goons beating up someone in broad daylight and no one comes to help him. Finally Peter decides to go back to being Spider-Man and steals the costume that JJ had kept in his office.Doc Oc is also another great character. I had seen him with an absolute blank slate, so I didn\\'t have any kind of expectation from him. And yet he surprised me. Someone who doesn\\'t want to be the bad guy but is slowly turning into one because his mind is not under his control. I was expecting Spider-Man to beat some sense into him the way he was doing in the train fight scene. But Spider-Man decided to do the absolutely right thing by talking him out of it and helping him gain back control over his senses. This is something I could only expect from Spider-Man. If it were someone like Iron Man or Batman he would have simply beaten him up till the machines stopped working. And that\\'s exactly what sets Spider-Man apart from the other superheroes.And finally we have the ending, where Peter and Mary are shown to have a happy ending while Harry is grieving over the fact that his best friend murdered his father. And when he discovers his father\\'s secret lab he knows what to do. Spider-Man trilogy is a perfect trilogy and I really like how this movie bridges Peter Parker from being a high school nerd to one of the greatest superheroes of all time.. \"Spider-Man 2\" remains one of my favorite superhero movies of all time. It improves on everything the first movie did so well, as any great sequel should. Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus is an all-time great villain performance, as well. The train scene between Spiderman and Doc Ock is my favorite action scene.. In my opinion this is one of the best comic book movies ever made. It\\'s fun, enjoyable and still holds up well to this day.. asdfghjklompnvnzbidndidndomfjuuuuuosmdmskmdkmqwxxcvmasdfghjhkglogkrmdmfmmmmmi. Spider-Man 2 isn\\'t just your average superohero film. It\\'s much more than that. Spider-Man 2 takes everything that made the original film so great and expands upon it. The action sequences are even more exciting, thanks in part to the bigger budget and improved special effects. The screenplay is fantastic and it manages to tell a personal Spider-Man story filled with heart and passion. Sam Raimi once again does an incredible job in staying true to the source material and humanizing the characters. The cast once again do a fantastic job in their roles, especially Tobey Maguire and Alfred Molina. Spider-Man 2 is just as entertaining as it is heartfelf and it will always remain one of the greatest superhero films of all time.. ●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●¡●:;:;:;:;:;:;;;;;:::::;:;:;:;:;:;;:;;;::::;;;;:;:;:;::;;;. perfect cast, perfect story, best comic book villain, one of the greatest spider-man movies ever made. nuff said. Spider-Man 2 is an uncommon instance where the sequel improves on the original. The story, writing, directing, acting and action are all just as good as they were in the first movie. This movie branches off of the first one really nicely by simply having us follow Peter Parker as his life continues, something other franchises won’t do but this one does really well. The structure of this film is in many ways the same as the previous one except for that Peter is already Spider-Man in this movie, giving us a slight difference that allows the film to be a bit quicker with it’s pacing and story development. This movie really amplifies Peter’s struggle to balance his school life with his “extracurricular commitments”, which again contributes to the relatability of this film. It might’ve nice to see a younger face play the role, but the movie gets around that well and doesn’t seem to be hampered by it. Alfred Molina’s iconic Doc Ock is a very similar villain to Norman Osborn which works well and shows that if a system isn’t broken, don’t fix it. The thing I appreciate most about this movie is that while there is action and are entertaining fight sequences, this film focuses much more on story and character development than it does action. Doc Ock’s arc adds a lot of depth to the movie and it’s great how Peter is able to contribute to that arc. Characters change and learn things in this movie much more than in the first one, which for me is where Spider-Man 2 improves on Spider-Man as SM 2 shows that you don’t need to have an overabundance of action for a movie based a superhero to be good. Spider-Man 2 has heart, depth and charm and is a must-see for fans of the character and Marvel fans in general as this movie set a very high bar that not many superhero movies have been able to live up to.. 8.7 is a much better rating than a 7.3 on IMDB which is bs. This movie is a cinematic masterpiece and is one of the best comic book movies, along with TDK, Infinity War, and Batman Begins.. Spider-man 2 easily builds one of the best protagonist in any comic book movie, and the movie so fun.. Still without a doubt one of the best comic book movies of all time after 17 years it holds up very well.. Masterpiece after almost 18 years.. Honestly, I DON\\'T LIKE THIS MOVIE. Don\\'t get me wrong, but I think there is too much hype around this movie. Yes, it\\'s one of the best comic book movies out there, and it\\'s a good movie, but not a good SUPERHERO movie. This movie is very slow and dramatic and while there are good fights there are FEW. And that\\'s what I expect from a superhero movie. ACTION. But after all these criticisms, I have to say that it\\'s a great movie, I enjoy watching it, and even if I prefer the first part, it\\'s still watchable.. This movie is Amazing, Best Superhero movie of the last ten years, even better than the Dark Knight, Superb acting, mezmerizing effects and moments that\\'ll last a life time, Sam Raimi has created a Cinematic masterpiece. Too Bad Spiderman 3 didn\\'t do to well. Could JK Simmons please reprise his role in the new Spiderman movies? He was born to play the part. This movie is one for the ages, A masterpiece!. Head and shoulders above the first one. It\\'s character-driven and much more interesting emotionally plus there\\'s more realistic dialogue and a cooler villain. Greatest comic book movie ever.  While a considerable improvement over the first in all areas, the choice of Alfred Molina as villain Doc Ock was beyond brilliant.  A total joy to watch over and over.. A splendid sequel to the already excellent first movie (by the way, I don\\'t see how this movie was significantly better than the first. All three Spider-Man movies are equally awesome).. Aside from some drama and the fact that they made Doctor Octopus look lame this was an awesome movie, great special effects, awesome action, and great humor made this one of the best comic book based movies I\\'ve seen, if your a Spider-Man fan you\\'ll love this movie.. This took the fun and energy of the first film and multiplied it by awesome.  It had a great story of personal conflict over whether to be happy in your personal life or possibly using the gifts you have to sacrifice that life to save others.  It was a enthralling story about true heroism to the point of oneâ. The most humane and one of the best superhero movies to ever be made. The movie succeeds to be a well-made character story on the personal trials of a superhero, laced with remarkable action sequences.. This Spider-Man, new and improved, hits all the right notes, has a perfect, bracing pace, and brings great new ideas to the screen. Surely when it was made, it was the best superhero movie ever. The Dark Knight now holds that position.. Many consider this as the best super hero film of all time. But I feel that it is inferior to the first Spider-Man. It has a slow mid point; joke sequences went a little bit too long. But it has one of the best super hero fight of all time.. Emotionally and cinematically brilliant that surpasses the original in everyway and even the rebooted Garfield-Spidey. One of my favourite superhero films of all time alongside Dark Knight Rises, Iron Man 3 and The Avengers.. Spider-man 2 es un gran film de acción y aventura, de los que dan gusto poder ver. He quedado maravillado y espero que así halla sido también para todos los espectadores. Una película que no solo marca una época dorada en el superhéroe, sino que también logra ser el mejor film del género de todos los tiempos, superando incluso a The Dark Knight.. Pizza Time Pizza Time Pizza Time Pizza Time Pizza Time Pizza Time Pizza Time Pizza Time. One of the best Superhero movies ever made. A movie with depth and feeling that shows us the human side of being super-human.  The things a hero might need to sacrifice to live their double life.  Complete with one of the best and fully fleshed out villains that is so rare in most comic book movies.  A must see for any comic book movie fan.. This is the best Spider-Man movie I\\'ve ever seen. It takes what the made original Spider-Man movie great and improves on it. Love the music as well as the fighting this is my favorite Super hero film out of them all.. A sequel that turns out to be better than the first, spider man 2 is more emotional, conflicted, and tells us how that spider man struggles with his powers.. Feel inspired to write a review of this after enduring Spiderman Homecoming.  This is the greatest superhero movie ever made. Utterly charming. Bar some dodgy CGI it\\'s oerfect. Tobey Maguire did a great job making Peter Parker a young man that you would feel for, wince with, and watch slowly as he turns from this young boy into a man.. Stop spamming negative reviews you bot!!!!!!. \\'Spider-Man 2\\' is sweet and innocent, with Raimi\\'s portrayal of honest human emotion bringing the warm, throbbing heart to this film that makes it so beloved. The pulchitrudinous dialogue drips with humble tears and emotional depth, provoking audiences to ponder on fundamental morality through the deliverance of messages that transcend the human race. Danny Elfman\\'s score contributes to my bucket of tears with the aid of the serene, harmonious strokes of strings that penetrate your very soul. This film is an uplifting, powerful and masterfully crafted one; it provides the comic-book fantasies that satisfy your inner child while coating it in a honeysuckle layer of themes that encourage good deeds to be done. It is a story of a man discovering himself, dealing with inner turbulence and confusion - a story that defines all of us and our struggles in ethically complicated situations. Raimi undoubtedly shows appreciation for rich character texture that elevate the impact of each character\\'s respective catharsis through the course of the storyline, yet leaving one to remain disturbed to overall create a bitter-sweet after-taste and a slightly open ending. Put simply, \\'Spider-Man 2\\' is an absolute delight that improves on the original and goes down as one of the best sequels of all-time, with The Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight, Superman II and The Godfather 2. \\'With great power comes great responsibility\\'. After SPIDER-MAN hit theaters in the summer of 2002, and raked in over $800 million worldwide, a sequel was a no-brainer, and only two years later, SPIDER-MAN 2 hit theaters. At one point, it looked like Tobey Maguire, who already seemed to be tiring of the typecasting linked to the part, wasn’t going to return to play Spider-Man, and Jake Gyllenhaal was actually waiting in the wings in case he called it quits. Of course, a huge paycheck lured Tobey back to the part, and the result was a film that was universally acclaimed by audiences, fans, and critics alike.Eight years later, how does SPIDER-MAN 2 hold up? Extremely well, and it stands as one of the top-tier superhero movies to ever hit the big-screen, comparing favorably with the later IRON-MAN, and even THE AVENGERS, although I’d put it a notch below BATMAN BEGINS/ THE DARK KNIGHT, and the great, unsung- X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (not to mention X2). The reason the film works as well as it does is mostly due to director Sam Raimi’s continued focus on Peter Parker’s inner turmoil. Working from a great script by Alvin Sargent (among others), SPIDER-MAN 2 opens with Parker, now a few years into being SPIDER-MAN, having brushed off his best friend Harry (due to his lingering guilt over his part in his father Norman/Green Goblin’s death, and the fact that Harry flies into a near-homicidal rage every time he hears the name Spider-Man), and avoided Mary-Jane. Now, Peter’s living in a disgusting one-room flat, eking out a meager living as a pizza delivery boy, while continuing his studies. Once he learns Mary-Jane is now engaged to J. Jonah Jameson’s pretty boy son, he goes off the rails- eventually quitting his superhero duties altogether, to pursue Mary-Jane. Of course, this is called SPIDER-MAN 2, and not PETER PARKER 2, so before long he dons his tights once again to fight the iconic Doc Ock, an unfortunate scientist who, after an accident, has metal arms molded to his back- and quickly goes nuts. Raimi balances the spectacle (with the climactic train sequence being a standout) and the darker, more emotional parts of the film beautifully, although- if one looks, the seeds of SPIDER-MAN 3’s idiocy are planted here, with a too jokey montage set to “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My Head” demonstrating Parker’s new-found freedom (complete with a freeze-frame we all thought was funny in 2004, but now suggests exactly the route we’d be going down a few years hence). Maguire, despite almost quitting the part, gives a solid performance, although I feel that his dedication to the part was already wearing thin by this, with his physique noticeably less impressive than it was in the first film, and the trend towards self-parody already taking hold. Still, he’s good enough that nobody who saw this in its initial release had any complaints. Following Willem Dafoe is no easy task, but Alfred Molina is up to it with his nuanced, tragic performance as Doc Ock. Even more sympathetic than Norman Osborn, Ock starts off as a nice-enough guy, but inadvertently causing his wife’s demise (not to mention getting giant robotic arms welded to his back) - he goes a little “funny in the head”. It all comes together in a nicely tragic conclusion. No Chad Kroger this time, and the pop rock takes a back-seat to Danny Elfman’s score- which plays very much like a retread of the first film. That said, numerous reports suggest that Elfman and Raimi had a major falling out over the project, and Elfman, who used to be Raimi’s go-to guy has never worked with him again. Rumor has it large chunks of his score were dropped and replaced. A sad end to a great collaboration- as Elfman’s score to DARKMAN (not to mention his theme for ARMY OF DARKNESS) is brilliant. SPIDER-MAN 2 didn’t quite measure up to the first film financially, but it did almost as well, grossing $373 million domestically, and another $375 million internationally, for another mammoth worldwide total of $783 million. It also fared much better than the first film critically, and for a time was considered the finest superhero film ever made.. The pleasure is doubled in “Spider-Man 2.” Crackerjack entertainment from start to finish, this rousing yarn about a reluctant superhero and his equally conflicted friends and enemies improves in every way on its predecessor and is arguably about as good a live-action picture as anyone’s ever made using comicbook characters. In one of those occasional examples of sequelmakers setting their sights higher the second time around and mostly hitting the mark, director Sam Raimi, producers Laura Ziskin and Avi Arad & Co., rather than equating bigger with better, have conscientiously applied themselves to improving all aspects of the franchise. Conspicuously, the action sequences are more exciting, the visual effects — particularly Spider-Man’s swings through the canyons of Manhattan — are far more natural and compelling and even Danny Elfman’s score is improved. Most importantly, however, the script provides a depth and dramatic balance quite rare in this sort of fare. Alvin Sargent, a distinguished vet screenwriter best known for such estimable character-driven fare as “Paper Moon,” “Julia,” “Ordinary People” and “Unfaithful,” did uncredited rewrites on the first “Spider-Man.” Here, working from a story devised by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar and Michael Chabon, he makes at least five characters into tortured souls with momentous decisions to make and places them all in a narrative frame within which the related elements are adroitly proportioned. Result is an object lesson in how, even for this sort of fare, the script can very much be the thing. Unlike the last round of “Batman” films, which got sillier with each installment, “Spider-Man” is on the upswing, an impression fostered even by the opening credits, which resemble the comicbook style of those in the original but incorporate arresting renderings of key scenes to recapitulate the first picture’s story. At the outset, Spider-Man is on a sort of hiatus, taking a back seat to the bumbling efforts of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) to juggle his studies at Columbia with part-time gigs taking pictures for the tabloid Daily Bugle and delivering pizzas on a strict schedule, which even Spidey’s best web-swinging can’t manage successfully. Opening section quickly pulls the viewer close to Peter by sympathetically and amusingly detailing the difficulties of his struggle to make ends meet in a tough city. He’s constantly reminded of his inexpressible feelings for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), whose face on a perfume campaign is plastered all over the city and who’s enjoying success onstage in a revival of “The Importance of Being Earnest.” Driven by a deep need to succeed where his father Norman failed, and still tormented over his death, Harry Osborn (James Franco) has invested heavily in the research of scientific genius Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), who believes he’s on the verge of creating a source of perpetual energy through sustained fusion. As the altruistic Octavius tells the admiring Peter, who intends to write his thesis on him, this breakthrough will put “the power of the sun in the palm of my hand.” But just as Norman Osborn’s experiment turned him into a demented villain, so does Octavius’; in front of numerous onlookers, his electrical gizmos bust a gut and his four enormous metal “activators” turn into murderous tentacles of staggering speed and strength, and capable of transporting the creature soon to be dubbed Dr. Octopus, or Doc Ock, up and down walls with ease. At the story’s precise midway point, Peter tosses his Spider-Man costume in the trash. A light-hearted interlude, cheekily accompanied by “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head,” illustrates the more balanced and happier young man Peter is able to become without the specter of Spider-Man constantly hovering over him; he hopes his fresh approach to life will win Mary Jane over before it’s too late, and in the bargain confesses to Aunt May his guilt for his part in the death of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, seen in one quasi-dream sequence). The new emotional levels and increased opportunities provided by the script give the actors a chance to stretch, and they all respond, none more than Maguire. Running the gamut from heroic knight to heartbroken suitor, thesp is a constant delight, his lightness of touch providing many grace notes to what was already a lively characterization. Dunst gets more screentime than before and fleshes out the damsel-in-distress aspects of her part with a nice portrait of a young woman trying to figure out where her future lies. With Aunt May finally, after two years of mourning, trying to move on, Harris has much more to do and does it with her customary excellence, and Franco pushes Harry into an unanticipated dark realm. Molina’s initial geniality morphs into a determined but unmaniacal evil, although the lack of a specific focus for his destructiveness makes Doc Ock\\'s real purpose a bit fuzzy. A great follow-up to Spider-Man!. Perfect. Nothing more to say.. Spider-Man 2 improved much more from the first one. The Villains, the action, the story and much more. Most overrated superhero movie ever! It was just as bad as the first one!!!. While Spider-Man 2 is plagued by similar issues of the first one (primarily some cheesy dialogue and acting) this film is a significant improvement over the first one. It has the same likeable characters (with actors far more comfortable in their roles) and sense of the fun the first one has but also has much more meat. The story is far more interesting and engaging this time around and the presentation is well done as well. The villain could have been better integrated into the film but as it is its down ok and everything else is really good. Additionally, the villain is much better. Overall, this is a really good film. Fans of the first one should definitely check it out as they are going to be in for a good time as the film is another great installment in the franchise. Nonfans of the first one should check out two, especially if you thought the first one lacked any substance. This is one of the best superhero films to come out of Marvel (even ten years later) and is definitely worth your time.. A far superior film than the first one. The villain here is more intriguing and purposeful. Spider-man himself goes through some ups and downs. The fight scenes were cooler and riveting. MJ serves the purpose of \\'damsel in distress\\' yet again. I don\\'t know anyone who would want to be with such an annoying person. Anyway, I enjoyed it.. I was 13 years old when Spider-Man 2 was released in 2004 and here we are, 12 years later and the film hasn\\'t lost any luster. In  this day and age, comic book movies are whats trending and even then, none of them quite compare to Spider-Man 2. When a movie is successful, sequels are usually a given. Some sequels succeed in living up to their predecessor while others don’t always succeed. There could be a variety of reasons for this, sometimes actors can\\'t or won\\'t come back due to scheduling conflicts. Other times, greed driven studio interference forces drastic changes upon the film which in part hinders the film\\'s success from the getgo. These things happen in Hollywood all the time in age of remakes and overdue sequels but this is not the case whatsoever with Spider-Man 2, a film which gets everything right, and does it so perfectly. The story is real and an emotionally driven journey of self-esteem and the boundaries of relationships and friendship when people are clouded by forces beyond their control. Tobey Maguire returns and puts on his best performance as the conflicted super-hero trying to juggle his crime fighting alter-ego and his attempt at an ordinary life of college and living alone while trying to pay bills and hold back his feelings for Mary Jane Watson.The film explores every avenue that deals in the consequences of Peter\\'s duality and alter ego as he struggles mightily trying to balance his life. I can\\'t say enough about Spider-Man 2 and just how perfect it was in almost every way.. \\'Spider-Man\\' (2002) was a fantastic introduction to the iconic Marvel character... director Sam Raimi was able to craft a thrilling - albeit, very violent - superhero movie where everyone was able to see the famous web-crawler swing into action, and now, can he strike again with \\'Spider-Man 2\\'? The answer is; not only can he strike again, but he does it so much better this time. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is back, and while still in love with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), he seems to be struggling balancing his life both being Spider-Man, trying to save the people of New York, and being Peter Parker, a student trying to catch up on work, and keeping his job. We see that Peter loses his job as a pizza delivery boy due to an inconvenience which led him to take action as Spider-Man, and even J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons), the editor of the Daily Bugle, is getting tired of Peter\\'s lack of exceptional work. Peter is also struggling to keep up with Dr. Conners\\' (Dylan Baker) classes, life is clearly just too overcrowded for our young hero. It seems that his best friend, Harry (James Franco) is not too keen on Peter taking pictures of Spider-Man for the Daily Bugle, as Harry is still not over the fact that Spider-Man (who is his best friend as well) may or may not have killed his father. Harry wants Spider-Man to pay for the pain that he has caused him over that time, which obviously puts Peter in a difficult position, because Harry could easily find out eventually. We meet an enthusiastic scientist named Dr. Octavious (Alfred Molina), who plans to create a fusion power project that has been sponsored by Harry, who is now head of the Oscorp division since his father\\'s tragic passing. Peter befriends Octavious, who even gives him advice on how to woo a girl, since Peter is finding it difficult to impress Mary Jane. During the fusion presentation, Dr. Octavious introduces the crowd to four, mechanical and electrical arms that are used to protect him while handling hazardous equipment. The fear that the advanced A.I. technology could overwhelm both his intelligence and mentality come true, as when the presentation goes wrong, and many are either left hurt or injured, Octavious then becomes slaves to the metal arms and pursues a life of crime to get the project running again. It seems that Peter may not be the man up for this, he starts to feel as if he is losing his powers, and gives up becoming Spider-Man. While he does, it seems that he is able to focus on the more important things in life such as; keeping up with school work, and living peacefully. But, when the crime in New York rises, many start to wonder where is Spider-Man?\\'Spider-Man 2\\' is a fun and riveting, and at times, dramatic adventure. Sam Raimi was able to take everything he did well from the first movie, and he doesn\\'t double it, or make it bigger... instead, he adds to it. He adds more features to this movie which makes it outshine the first. Molina is fantastic as the vulnerable Dr. Octavious, who reluctantly becomes a villain to get what he wants, even though he clearly doesn\\'t want to hurt anybody. The way this movie explores the vulnerability of the main villain adds to the tension and drama. \\'Spider-Man 2\\' is, in short, amazing.. A truly amazing superhero movie. The story is spectacular and the greatly updated special effects make this movie fantastic. Good acting, loveable characters, a great villain and a stupendous love story are why this movie is just . . .  Good. Rating- 93%. Plenty call this the ultimate Spider-Man movie. The one that you can\\'t literally say anything bad about, but, unfortunately, it\\'s definitely got flaws. From Tobey\\'s uncomfortable face expressions, to the screaming that is more hilarious than dramatic to the acting that has not aged too well. But, overall? This is one of the greatest comic book movies, indeed. I\\'d take this over a Captain America film anyday, because in the end, the corniness makes this film what it is and tells an excellent story of the popular franchise Spider-Man. Definitely a superior and total improvement from the first film.. Rarely does a sequel trump its original, but \"Spider-Man 2\" manages to do so with an extremely intriguing villain and higher emotional stakes.. This was much better than the first one. Alfred Molina\\'s role as Doc Ock was as good as Willem Dafoe\\'s green goblin.. Taking nearly every element of the first film and elevating it, \"Spider-Man 2\" is everything a sequel should be and more.. A great sequel that follows on closely after the events of the first film. It\\'s just as fast-paced and entertaining, and with the majority of the main players back for round two any fans of the first film will enjoy this one. Any of the Spider-Man films are certainly one of my favourites when it comes to Superhero movies, and this is no exception as its nothing but a joy to watch. I think the third and final chapter in this trilogy fell a little, but the sequel is a quality Action film. From Great Power Comes With Great Responsibility! Is the moral of the movie.Peter Parker is struggling with his normal life and  his powers,this movie is not just a superhero flick but also give us the sense of how hard is it to be a superhero,in normal life you\\'ll be facing many problems like love life,friends,Jobs and many More if being a superhero well you will be dealing with villains.Spider-Man 2 is well written and well directed but sometimes it\\'s goofy but the goofiness of the movie make it more appealing unlike the sequel of the new reboot that looks like a video game.Spider-Man 2 is the best spider-man movie so far.. Spider man cada vez escalando mas hacia un buen futuro................................................................................................. \"Spider man 2\" is decent. There is a lot to see but less to think or develop. Better to watch with your friends for pure joy, laughing at the corny dialogue and \\'ooh-aah\\'ing at the impressive action sequences.. I guess you have to be a Spidey fan in order to love this movie. Still, I don\\'t see how anyone can defend the horrible performances from James Franco or Kirsten Dunst. I guess if you\\'re the kind of person who doesn\\'t mind an awful line like \"go get em tiger\", you will love this movie. I mean I can identify with Peter Parker. Like Doc Ock says I am also \"smart, but lazy\". I also have no idea how to talk to women. I should love this movie, but I can\\'t look past the fact that it is not very well done. And stop talking about the special effects. They don\\'t make a movie great. Especially when that movie rips off Superman II. If this movie had won Oscars, it would have been the most overrated movie of all time.. I guess I wouldn\\'t make a very good movie producer because I would have shelved this thing and missed out on all the money it?s raking in. Why is it doing that I ask myself ? who knows because as far as I?m concerned this is nothing more than some touchy-feely love story, finding one self, soap opera with over-special-effected ?action? scenes. Heck, I got the feeling the only reason those were there at all was to break-up the monotony of Peter Parker wondering around being torn over his, life, loves, purpose, blah, blah, blah. Yikes, I paid money to see this dribble.. it wasn\\'t that good, at least not good enough to earn a 8.9 rating, I have to admit I like watching this but wow, it surely doesn\\'t deserve such an effervescence. With Parker continuing to struggle with the responsibility of being a superhero the Spider-Man sequel is as successful at combining action, comedy and character development as the first movie . Doctor Octopus also provides a great nemesis for the hero and the fight scenes between the two make for some excellent action sequences. Highly recommended.. Pretty much the same as I felt about the previous film. I didnt like the acting much but the action was good and it was entertaining for the most part. It could get rather dull though and that did take away from it.. WHAT I LIKED: A film that\\'s overall an improvement over it\\'s predecessor, \\'Spider Man 2\\' has much more character and relationship development that makes the film appear more realistic, you can empathise more with Peter in this film too, and the special effects and action are well improved over the first. The villain is also feels more dangerous and less bizzare and comical as the Green Goblin did in the first.WHAT I DIDN\\'T LIKE: It\\'s still very cheesy and cliched, and it\\'s not excatly the most interesting of plots. It also lacks character arcs and sub-stories that could make it more layered.VERDICT: A successful sequel to say the least, this is much improved over the first thanks to it\\'s new focus on emotional elemtns and character relationships.. I guess you have to be a Spidey fan in order to love this movie. Still, I don\\'t see how anyone can defend the horrible performances from James Franco or Kirsten Dunst. my question is how did spider-man 2 score better than the first instalment. Spider-man 2 is 50 times worse than the first spider-man movie the story is worse,the acting is 100 times worse and toby maquire is acts more and more like a baboon and is acting still sucks.How people liked this movie is mind boggling.one word to describe the movie \"Terrible\".Once again this is one of the worst movie sequels in the history of sequels.. [***SPOILERS***] Where to begin? The plot of this film is incoherent. Doctor Octopus needs those tentacles to...do what exactly? All he does with them in the lab scene (his lab in a residential space) is press a button. Later on, the villian robs a bank for...money that he will use to...do what? Buy lab equipment? Does anyone see the stupidity here? Why not just take what you want? The best of all: Doc Ock goes to James Franco and demands the precious McGuffin of \\'tridium.\\' Rather than just ransack Franco\\'s home and take it, or torture him and take it, Ock makes an unncessary deal to risk his life and hunt down Spider-Man for it. Smart. Onto the dialogue. What young people talk as Tobey and that hideous actress do in this film? \\'Go get\\'em tiger?\\' Seriously? This is what happens when 50 year old Hollywood hacks write for allegedly cool young people. That the actors did not speak up proves they were out to cash a check. The public, inc. the critics, is brainwashed by an assault of hype into liking this dreck. People so desperately want to like it, that they overlook wack, weak plot and dialogue. \\'It\\'s just a summer movie,\\' is no excuse. Just because I am in a movie theater doesn\\'t mean I have to check logic and common sense at the door. But in a culture where people are content eating fast food day in and day out while listening to Ashlee Simpson and reading US Weekly, why should anyone be suprised this movie is a hit? Kirsten Dunst is another issue altogether. Apparently just because someone is on a big screen or magazine covers, they become pretty. This girl\\'s face in those ECU shots is downright scary. She belongs in an old Raimi zombie flick. But again, if you luck into a big role because you\\'ve been chasing fame since you were a child actress, then you just become pretty. Become famous in our society and suddenly you also become physically attractive? Finally, Raimi\\'s cheese shots of people screaming is just wack camp. Much preferred Nolan\\'s Batman.. This was possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.. This film was awful. The classic dilemma of Peter Parker simply does not translate to present day. Our hero is a man in love with a woman he can\\'t have regardless of how many times he is forced to repel her advances. His obstacle to ecstasy with MJ is his fear that his enemies might exploit the obvious weakness a superhero\\'s girlfriend would inherently be. Who thinks this way? Any man, in a similar situation, would nail the chick without fear or remorse. This heroic dilemna is so alien to the audience they actually have to explicitly state the hero\\'s dilemna. And...of course...in a truly risky casting move...NYC is cast as the innocent victim of the crime our Anthro-Arachnid friend must fight. What I find so absurd is the ridiculously high score awarded this film by the meta-critic crowd. Is everyone on the payroll of this film? Please Tobey...end it now and go back to independent film!!!. Couple things... 1. Just because someone coined a lame, corny catch phrase for a character in a comic book for people with 3rd-grade reading comp is no excuse for using said lame line in a 200 million dollar film. 2. Just because the lame, corny, \\'Go get\\'em tiger\\' line was used in the comic does not mean it is good, or should be used in the film version. 3. 3. If I want to read a comic, I\\'ll buy a comic. If I want to go see a movie, even one BASED ON a comic, I hope to get a storyline and dialogue of higher quality than that offered in the comic. Spider-Man 2 fails to offer a coherent plot. It\\'s dialogue is lame. Finally, even those die-hard comic fans will reject the 3rd installment of this crap-- Topher Grace as Venom. I\\'m no comic expert, but I thought Venom was, like, muscular and imposing. I also thought the costume was black with a white spider, not that corny-looking thing on the trailer.. Extremely overrated. Unbearably corny and sappy by times. Although I\\'m sure this is straight from the comics but why does Peter have to know all his villians personally before they become villians? I find this unrealistic plot point distracting but I\\'m willing to get over it if the movie worked...which I found only when the action kicked in gear. I loved the first Spidey, thought it was stylish and rang true...here\\'s hoping that Spidey 3 is more like the first.. Spider-Man 2 has a good villain but Raimi thinks he can fit such emotional drama with a little love story that the movie would\\'ve been fine without. Doc Oct was a great villain who was played perfectly and who could have stole the show, if not for Kirsten Dunst and her stupid part.. After the very good spider-man (2002), this sequel makes no sense, Peter is a loser who never does anything scientific as in the comic and has no charisma. The only good thing is Alfred Molina.. Overhyped? absoultetly. but still alot of fun! with an incrdible score, as the whole trilogy has, Raimi kicks it up a notch for this sequel. while still being campy Spider-Man 2 brings in more drama that does get over the top. Spider-Man 2 one of the best comic book movies ever? no but it does hold a place for one of the best comic book movie fight scenes ever....the train sequence. [Portuguese] Decaiu em comparação com o primeiro filme mas continuou bem legal de se ver, vi várias vezes, mas esse Homem-Aranha já estava começando a me incomodar devido ao seu jeito chorão.. A great sequel that follows on closely after the events of the first film. It\\'s just as fast-paced and entertaining, and with the majority of the main players back for round two any fans of the first film will enjoy this one. Any of the Spider-Man films are certainly one of my favourites when it comes to Superhero movies, and this is no exception as its nothing but a joy to watch. I think the third and final chapter in this trilogy fell a little, but the sequel is a quality Action film.. While Spider-Man being the best of the franchise, this second runner-up still has its visual details from the first movie and bought us the chillness back.. The pleasure is doubled in “Spider-Man 2.” Crackerjack entertainment from start to finish, this rousing yarn about a reluctant superhero and his equally conflicted friends and enemies improves in every way on its predecessor and is arguably about as good a live-action picture as anyone’s ever made using comicbook characters. In one of those occasional examples of sequelmakers setting their sights higher the second time around and mostly hitting the mark, director Sam Raimi, producers Laura Ziskin and Avi Arad & Co., rather than equating bigger with better, have conscientiously applied themselves to improving all aspects of the franchise. Conspicuously, the action sequences are more exciting, the visual effects — particularly Spider-Man’s swings through the canyons of Manhattan — are far more natural and compelling and even Danny Elfman’s score is improved. Most importantly, however, the script provides a depth and dramatic balance quite rare in this sort of fare. Alvin Sargent, a distinguished vet screenwriter best known for such estimable character-driven fare as “Paper Moon,” “Julia,” “Ordinary People” and “Unfaithful,” did uncredited rewrites on the first “Spider-Man.” Here, working from a story devised by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar and Michael Chabon, he makes at least five characters into tortured souls with momentous decisions to make and places them all in a narrative frame within which the related elements are adroitly proportioned. Result is an object lesson in how, even for this sort of fare, the script can very much be the thing. Unlike the last round of “Batman” films, which got sillier with each installment, “Spider-Man” is on the upswing, an impression fostered even by the opening credits, which resemble the comicbook style of those in the original but incorporate arresting renderings of key scenes to recapitulate the first picture’s story. At the outset, Spider-Man is on a sort of hiatus, taking a back seat to the bumbling efforts of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) to juggle his studies at Columbia with part-time gigs taking pictures for the tabloid Daily Bugle and delivering pizzas on a strict schedule, which even Spidey’s best web-swinging can’t manage successfully. Opening section quickly pulls the viewer close to Peter by sympathetically and amusingly detailing the difficulties of his struggle to make ends meet in a tough city. He’s constantly reminded of his inexpressible feelings for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), whose face on a perfume campaign is plastered all over the city and who’s enjoying success onstage in a revival of “The Importance of Being Earnest.” Driven by a deep need to succeed where his father Norman failed, and still tormented over his death, Harry Osborn (James Franco) has invested heavily in the research of scientific genius Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), who believes he’s on the verge of creating a source of perpetual energy through sustained fusion. As the altruistic Octavius tells the admiring Peter, who intends to write his thesis on him, this breakthrough will put “the power of the sun in the palm of my hand.” But just as Norman Osborn’s experiment turned him into a demented villain, so does Octavius’; in front of numerous onlookers, his electrical gizmos bust a gut and his four enormous metal “activators” turn into murderous tentacles of staggering speed and strength, and capable of transporting the creature soon to be dubbed Dr. Octopus, or Doc Ock, up and down walls with ease. At the story’s precise midway point, Peter tosses his Spider-Man costume in the trash. A light-hearted interlude, cheekily accompanied by “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head,” illustrates the more balanced and happier young man Peter is able to become without the specter of Spider-Man constantly hovering over him; he hopes his fresh approach to life will win Mary Jane over before it’s too late, and in the bargain confesses to Aunt May his guilt for his part in the death of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, seen in one quasi-dream sequence). The new emotional levels and increased opportunities provided by the script give the actors a chance to stretch, and they all respond, none more than Maguire. Running the gamut from heroic knight to heartbroken suitor, thesp is a constant delight, his lightness of touch providing many grace notes to what was already a lively characterization. Dunst gets more screentime than before and fleshes out the damsel-in-distress aspects of her part with a nice portrait of a young woman trying to figure out where her future lies. With Aunt May finally, after two years of mourning, trying to move on, Harris has much more to do and does it with her customary excellence, and Franco pushes Harry into an unanticipated dark realm. Molina’s initial geniality morphs into a determined but unmaniacal evil, although the lack of a specific focus for his destructiveness makes Doc Ock\\'s real purpose a bit fuzzy. A great follow-up to Spider-Man!. Another great movie. This is even better than the first one.And the first one was AMAZING.Another great job by Tobey and the rest of the cast.Give a 10. This movie has dazzling effects and action, but I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t help but be annoyed by how stupid Peter has become, how even more **** Mary Jane has come, and how idiotic Harry is thinking that just because Peter takes pictures of Spider-Man, automatically means that Peter knows who Spider-Man is. It also doesn\\'t help that Spider-Man\\'s powers disappear for no realistic biological reason. I can\\'t believe people just gloss over these flaws.. Seeing Peter Parker trying to be himself as Spider-Man is a struggle, emotional, and accurate of how things are in real life which is why it\\'s my favorite superhero movie ever.. Without a doubt, this is the best movie about \"Spider-Man\" of all time. In it there is literally everything that we love in superhero movies: action, plot, villain, great shooting, beautiful picture and atmosphere. There is also lots of the director\\'s unique insanity in it, but I think it only benefited the film. It is unlikely that noone will be able to film \"Spider-Man\" better.. An example of how to make the perfect sequel, a movie far superior than the original. Spider-Man 2 is not only a great superhero summer flick, it\\'s actually a great movie too. This movie actually gives main character Peter Parker a realistic internal conflict: Should he continue to be Spider-Man and struggle to keep a normal life? Or should he stop being Spider-Man and have a normal life? This movie focuses on that conflict leading to the best writing, directing and acting of the trilogy and probably from any live-action Spider-Man movie.The action scenes are way better and more intense than the previous film, the train fight scene is probably one of the most memorable and best action scenes in any superhero movie ever.After all, this is still a Sam Raimi Spider-Man movie and there\\'s some cheesy stuff like some dialogue and some scenes (like I think the Dr. Octopus hospital scene was supposed to be horryfing and turned out to be unintentionally funny).This is an amazing superhero movie, one of the best ever made and till this day the best live-action Spider-Man movie ever. This is one of the movies that truly showed the world that superhero movies can be competent movies and not just dumb action.. It is definitely a hard task to find any mixed or nuanced reviews about this movie. I have to admit I like watching this but wow, it surely doesn\\'t deserve such an effervescence !Special effects didn\\'t aged that bad and remain quite pleasant to see. The story isn\\'t that original but benefits from a great pace in general. Acting varies between amazing (especially for James Franco), cheesy on McGuire\\'s side or inexistent (speaking of Kristen Dunst in particular). The soundtrack is decent and the fast-paced action scenes are terrific. I would say the major issue with this movie is the predictability of its scenario and the numerous clichés it manages to gather.. ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ. Idc what anyone says but Spider-Man 2 is better then the MCU. Fight me as this movie was a masterpiece.. It\\'s very boring and slow. The redemption arc is nice, and the story is fine, but it is very boring and overrated. Kirsten Dunst is horrible, Tobey maguire is mediocre, and the rest (except for the rare good action) is very, very, slow.. Omg after 17 years this movie is still amazing! It holds up so well this movie.. I rewatched this after years and I appreciate this movie so much more. The most faithful comic adaptation I’ve ever seen.. amazing from start to finish. spider-man is without a doubt the best comic character to be translated to the big screen.. I just caught this movie on hbo again the other day and damn do i love this movie. it really does have everything mixed into one movie. it captures the spirit of the comic book perfectly, while also translating to mainstream audiences. i can not wait for the next one.. Quite possibly the best superhero movie of all time. You have all the high-powered action scenes, a great sense of humor, and ritual symbolism that would even get Joseph Campbell\\'s mind stirring. It\\'s long, but well-paced, and never forgets its sense of humility. By the end, Spider-Man\\'s world is ripe for further installments, and anyone who ever walked through a toy aisle or played recess will want to see them.. A very strong, intelligent and emotional movie. Most likely one of the greatest movies ever. Anonymous needs to seek therapy.. It was a good movie. Not a classic like the original and not atrocious like its successor.. Great action movie but it showed tremendous emotion. Great story, great movie, end of story.. This film has everything going for it. Freat special effects and action sequences, craking dialogue, a terrific performance from Maguire and Molina. Just like a Spider-man comic brought to the big screen with all the heart, fun and excitement. If you so much as like superhero movies, you should love this.. Having re-watched this recently--and perhaps this partially a nostalgic bias--this is undoubtedly the greatest comic book film ever made. Hands down. Just the sheer level of enjoyment that it evokes, without sacrificing intelligence, acting, direction, any of that--it\\'s literally one of the few movies that contains the pure entertainment that has been lost more and more since the golden days of adventure back in the 70s. The Dark Knight had it\\'s own post-humous/intense hype awe factor, but in terms of how many times you can just sit back and watch the film, while being consistently entertained--the only film that comes close is Iron Man. But nothing holds a candle to Spidey 2.Nothing.. It was the greatest movie in all of history. no better movie than this. I don\\'t read bad reviews for this movie.. Oh My God. I see all of you neigh-sayers complaining about this movie. Some of you go as far as to say that it is nothing like the comic. Trust me, anyone who reads the comics or even follow it slightly will tell you that this is what you will and should get from the movie. It \"is\" EXACTLY LIKE THE COMIC.. There are plenty of superhero movies that provide gratuitous action--action with no cost or reason. This movie takes the time to look at its characters, develop them, raise the stakes for them, thus giving the action reason. Then we care if Aunt May is taken hostage, or whether Doc will win that fight. Yes, this means less action. Gasp! But with more riding on it, it is a lot more satisfying.. Without a doubt the best comic book movie of all time. this movie had it all. and it is easy to see that frank r. and the realness are the same exact person trying to bring the score down, because of some asinine hatred of this movie, so i am here to rectify that.. Great acting from Raimi and the rest of the cast (except Dunst). [***SPOILERS***] Unfortunately the lines were terrible as between Parker and Mary Jane, and the \\'happy-go-lucky\\' scene with Parker after \\'losing\\' his powers is an inappropriate splash of camp in what has been a serious, if light hearted, adaptation endeavor.. Lighten up people. Its not hard to love this movie unless you have absolutely no ability of knowing good entertainment when u see it. Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst Lovely as MJ, Alfred Molina an outstanding classic machined villain as Dr. Octavious turned Docock. Every member of the cast is superb in their big or small roles, Sam Raimi the director seems very sure of the script and his directing and makes every scene worth watching. Add to that a good story, fabulous, marvelous special effects and visual sequences, an outstanding, fully suitable score, sound effects beyond your wildest dreams , a red-blue spidey Spandex otfit, a chuuby guys in a brown coat with four mecha-arms...well how can you not like it??? So, either you are a fan of the comics, like superhero movies, or not, you really have to enjoy this movie. SO DONT MISS IT!. The best comic book movie ever made. No...no....let me rephrase that. This is one of the greatest movies of all time. Absolutely powerful and just plain fun to watch.. This movie is the best comic book adaptation, and is much better than spider man 1. It was a funnier, has more emotion and heart, great story, and a fantastic action with amazing CGI on doc oc. Spiderman 1 was more of an intro, but spiderman 2 displayed the wrenching consequences that comes along with having all this power.. The greatest comic book film of all time...so far. This one had it all. It had wonderful writing that dealt with angst,ambition, loss, love, and redemption and it did so with heart as well as a dash of humor. It had well written characters that were multi-faceted and it had a talented cast to bring these charcters to life. It\\'s action sequences(the train fight was incredible!!!)that were intense and entertaining, but never overshadowed the characters. Good stuff indeed!!!. Hey Anonymous, \"go get em tiger\" is Mary Jane\\'s catch phrase from the comic, so it\\'s pretty easy to defend.. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The special effects were spectacular.. An incredible work of art. Much improved from the first Spider-man, this movie is possibly the best super hero film of all time.. Spider-Man 2 is one of the best super-hero movies ever made. The action scenes are decent, but it\\'s the emotional heft of the story and the innocence of Maguire\\'s  Spidey that really connects. You just can\\'t help but root for such a good-hearted, self sacrificing hero.. Whoa, I didn\\'t expect \"Spider-Man 2\" to not only be better than the first film, but by quite a lot. This film is emotionally satisfying, has excellent action scenes, and great acting. If you are a fan of the first movie, you must check out this exciting sequel.. This is the best of the Spider-Man movies. Along with riding a lot of the success of the first film, Spider-Man 2 upgrades the series with great effects, a more human villain, emotional renaissance and humor.. Melhorou muito em relação ao seu ótimo primeiro filme.. Far superior to the first film. The movie does a really good job at showing Parker\\'s relationship with Octavius that is similar to the comics. Alfred Molina is just fantastic as Dr Octopus, a real shame he didn\\'t have his accent from the comics and cartoon series, but that really was just a minor quip. The movie really does a great job at showing Parker\\'s struggle to be both Peter Parker and Spider-man, granted it\\'s really tamed down from the comics but considering there is a limited amount of screen time they do a decent job of it. Overall: Probably the best Spider-Man movie in the franchise so far.. Let me start by saying that this is NOT the best spider-man movie. While good, I don\\'t think that tobey maguire was good as spider-man(same for kirsten dunst, who played MJ). James Franco was good, awesome subway acton sequence, and whoever played J. Jonah Jameson was excellent. This movie was good, but nothing more than good.. This film is, without a doubt, the definitive cinematic Spider-Man experience, for people who are into all genres and of all ages. It has excellent over-the-top superhero action, pee-your-pants humour, and best of all, by far the best Spider-Man villain, Doctor Octopus, who is wonderfully portrayed in this picture. Maguire is the perfect Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst does a top job as Mary Jane. My only real criticism of this film is that a lot of the dialogue is rather weak, and a large amount of the extras are rather unrealistically sterile. But all of this makes for an outstanding superhero film, and one that I would be happy to come back to time and time again.. This is a great movie. The story is great and the action sequences are awesome. Alfred Molina was great as Doc Ock and James Franco nailed it again as Harry Osborn. As a big Spidey fan, I have to say that this movie is better than the first one.. Spider-Man 2 is one of the best superhero movies I\\'ve ever seen, and in my opinion, better than the first movie due to great special effects, a great story, and Alfred Molina\\'s performance as Doc Ock.. This is a perfect comic book movie, plus a sequel. I had high expectations since I saw the first Spiderman movie. And I got to say, it really met up to my expectations. If you weren\\'t a fan of the Spiderman comics, or the original shows and whatnot, this can change your mind.. The second film could be a runner-up for my favorite comicbook movie. The first one was campy, but this film I\\'d argue is legitimately good. It is goofy, but remember that it\\'s a COMICBOOK movie, so it can pass. It\\'s an entertaining flick from beginning to end and has a lot of heart. I much prefer the extended cut(Spider-Man 2.1) since it extends the already brilliant action scenes and gives some more moments to the supporting characters. It may be over ten-years-old, but it\\'s still the best Spider-Man movie. It\\'s probably in my Top 10 All Time Favorite Films, it just leaves you with such a satisfying feel at the end, which kind of makes Spider-Man 3 all the more disappointing.... It\\'s not easy for a sequel to improve on its predecessor, but \"Spider-Man 2\" does it fabulously. Entertaining characters, great acting, intense action scenes, a well-told story and one of the best villains in the film series, \"Spider-Man 2\" has it all. To this day, it still stands as the best Spider-Man film in the series. If you haven\\'t seen the film yet, well, what are you waiting for? Go watch \"Spider-Man 2\" now!. The best Spider-Man film released and one of the greatest superhero movies of all time.  The emotion oozes and the tension rises in this sequel. Alfred Molina is perfect as Doc Ock.. Spider-man 2 doesn\\'t excite.Just a continuation of the average Peter Parker with the same powers, the same problems, and the same girl that he can\\'t seem to get. Spider-man 2 plays out an unrealistic villain with cheesy dialogue and no real spectacular elements.. This movie was perfect, Alfred Molina was fantastic as Doc Occ, the relationship between Harry and Peter was good, everything in this movie was awesome. The fact that people prefer the newer movies simply because Andrew Garfield is more handsome is so freaking stupid?!! Tobey Maguire nail it with his acting in this movie!. No other Spider-Man movie touches this. Perfect comic book movie, amazing characters and script, best Spider-Man actor, JK Simmons, etc. True Marvel fans will see this as the best Spider-Man movie and one of the best masterpieces to ever be seen.You don\\'t even have to be a Spider-Man fan to enjoy it.. Spider-man 2 is way much better than the first because there is more action and more suspense.Octopus is my favourite villain in spider-man and what is wrong with him is that he dies at the end.. The follow up to Sam Raimi\\'s 2002 \"spider-Man\" lived up to the hype and didn\\'t disappoint. This is the best Spidey film to date and one of the top 5 superhero movies of all time. The new villain this time is Doc Ock played by Alfred Molina and boy did he turn in a masterful performance. I couldn\\'t see anyone else play this role better. Great film. A must watch.. Although it\\'s far from perfect, Spiderman 2 is precisely the sort of film that I\\'m always impressed by. It leaps beyond it\\'s origins and deals with something different and unconventional. It talks about- the burden of responsibility, the burden of being a superhero, how it\\'s not exactly the dream job. There are thousands of children around the world who turn off their lights at night, shut their eyes and pray for superpowers. Sam Rami\\'s Spiderman 2 tries to point out that perhaps one should think twice. \"With great power comes great responsibility\". A superhero has to make sacrifices and give up the things he wants most, even his dreams. The film builds this idea wonderfully till the ending where they completely throw everything out of the window so as to make way for the sappy, hollywood manufactured ending. But despite the infuriating puppy dog happy ending forced into the film, it\\'s still Marvel\\'s best film to date.. Superheroes Anonymous Tragically I am a Batman. An obsessive Caped Crusader comic-book collector until 1972 when my evil mother tossed the entire bunch in the garbage. My cousin was Spider-man. His noble mother preserved his collection with plastic envelopes and to this day they remain in pristine condition. What\\'s truly tragic about being a Batman is that, despite Nolan\\'s recent attempts (and questionable sincerity), the best Batman movie hasn\\'t been made yet. As far as we know, with Batman\\'s fate resting with Warner Bros, David Goyer, Zak Snider and Ben Affleck, the best Batman movie will not be possible for another decade or two, maybe three. I await thee Dark Knight. Again to my cousin\\'s good fortune, the best movie about Spider-man has been established for quite some time. In fact, as a benchmark, it is arguably the best comic-book super-hero movie ever made. I didn\\'t much love Sam Raimi\\'s first Spider-man, and wished my mother could have disposed of his last entry, but Spider-man 2 was, and is, the ultimate movie adaptation from comic-books to the movie screen. I was living in Shanghai in the summer of 2004 where I had to commute 3 hours on a hot and dizzy day to see it in English, and was fully rewarded for the effort. I was thrust into a imaginary super-hero world far more pleasing than anything I could remember since childhood. The 3 hour commute back home seemed like a breeze because Spider-man 2 awoke the wonder-struck boy inside me. It reminded me of a happy youth I forgot I had. It felt like Spidey was on the subway with me and would protect me from any harm. And he was just a boy himself! Batman? Who\\'s that? For a super-hero story, nearly everything is perfect in this movie. Doc Ock couldn\\'t have been better. He looked exactly the way he did, at the height of Stan Lee\\'s eminence, in the brightly coloured panels fighting Spiderman in 1968. And sounded just like I imagined he would. Peter and Mary Jane were in their element and their friendship and romantic undertaking actually mattered. The story and action played out the way a comic book should. It was both intimate and fantastic. Trippy, wonderful and scary. It was like growing up all over again. The climax was a bit too flashy, loud and over-the-top at that time, but by today\\'s standards, when compared to climactic train-wrecks in Man of Steel, Iron Man 3 and the Avengers, it\\'s perfectly splendid. We are now being helplessly bombarded with comic book movies attacking us from every direction, all of them trying to out-do each other, jumping one shark after another. Every marginal superhero from Dr Strange to Shazam is being dusted off and hurled onto the big screen for our insatiable happy-childhood-appeasing appetite. The Marvel of Disney is launching at us one theme-park roller-coaster ride after another. Sony, with their Amazing Spider-man abominations, has completely lost it. Fox\\'s X-Men and Fantastic Four proliferations hit the wall long ago. And DC, under the reigns of Warner Bros, has transfigured into its own worst enemy. A wretched mutation not even the Joker finds amusing. Turns out Sam Raimi\\'s Spiderman 2 is the gold standard by which all comic-book movies, certainly those of the super-hero variety, are and, evidently, will be set. Lucky cousin.. In the second installment in the Spider-Man series, based on the classic Marvel Comics hero, Tobey Maguire returns as the mild-mannered Peter Parker, who is juggling the delicate balance of his dual life as a college student and a superhuman crime fighter. The entertaining adventure escalates and Spider-Man\\'s life becomes even more complicated when he confronts a new nemesis, the brilliant Otto Octavius, (Molina) who has been reincarnated as the maniacal and multi-tentacled \"Doc Ock.\". 10 years later and it\\'s still one of the best if not the best Spider-Man movie ever and in my opinion the best super hero movie. it has great action, a great story, a great cast of characters and great music to top it all off. If your a Spider-Man fan (or just love super hero movies) and haven\\'t watched the movie, (or if you haven\\'t seen it in a long while) than I strongly recommend getting the film.. Soy un gran fan de Spider-Man, y esta película me parece una obra de arte. Buena historia, buena acción y buenos efectos especiales. Sin duda, Spider-Man 2 es la mejor película de Spider-Man de todas y una de las mejores películas de superhéroes de todos los tiempos.. While this movie its indeed the best of ALL of spider man\\'s movies, it\\'s not my favorite. Doc Oc is amazing with Alfred Molina\\'s as the guy behind the tentacles. He brings emotion and anger to his character... something Tobey never could with his.Honestly this movie is this good because of Alfred Molina.. Without a doubt, this movie improves upon the original with a better and more understandable villain in the form of Doc Ock. It\\'s definitely another must-see film directed by Sam Raimi.. It may take a while for the action to start up in Spider-Man 2, but when it does, it\\'s great. This sequel deals on the inner turmoil our protagonist must face not only as Spider-Man, but as an adult living in the real world - a nice contrast by the writer(s). The new villain, Doc Oc, is way better than The Green Goblin could ever hope to achieve. He\\'s a struggling soul just as Spider-Man, only his has been focused on better achieving what he failed to do, as is Spider-Man\\'s - saving the world after the death of his uncle. The scripth here is great. The acting once again, very well done, Simmon\\'s character is wonderful. The music is basically the same from the first, a misstep by the composer Danny Elfman. Overall, this is a great sequel and could very well exist had the first not been made.. The 2002 box-office smash Spider-Man didn\\'t just warrant a sequel; it demanded one. Sam Raimi\\'s superhero epic was a textbook example of how to bring a beloved comic book to the big screen with its spirit intact, just as its terrific follow-up illustrates how a sequel can build and expand on its predecessor rather than simply cannibalizing it. Simultaneously funnier, darker, and more emotional than its forebear, Spider-Man 2 opens with its web-slinging protagonist (Tobey Maguire, deftly balancing action and angst) at a low ebb. Tired of his indecisiveness, his would-be girlfriend Kirsten Dunst has moved on to a less conflicted suitor. Maguire\\'s gig as a freelance photographer is constantly in danger, while professor Dylan Baker views him as brilliant but lazy, little realizing that Maguire\\'s extracurricular activities involve more than the usual bong-huffing and channel-surfing. Cracking under the strain of his thankless job rescuing a regularly imperiled New York that still views him with suspicion, and dismayed by a sudden reduction in his web-slinging abilities, Maguire decides to retire his Spider-Man ensemble and pursue the simple pleasures that come with not having to save the world. His resolve is tested, however, when Alfred Molina dramatically transforms from an endearingly dorky scientist to super-villain Dr. Octopus, a malevolent, David Cronenberg-esque fusion of man and machine with sinister mechanical arms that have an evil will all their own. Raimi and his screenwriters—including two-time Academy Award winner Alvin Sargent and novelist Michael Chabon—use their characters\\' superhuman powers to amplify the issues and concerns of a human story. Spider-Man 2 wrestles with conflicts between power and responsibility, but the filmmakers smartly counter heavy drama with goofy comedy, mining a rich vein of humor in the juxtaposition of the mundane and the superheroic. Maguire and Molina excel at opposite ends of the moral spectrum, but the film is stolen once again by J.K. Simmons as Maguire\\'s belligerent, relentlessly self-serving motormouth of a boss, whose office is a loving oasis of retro screwball comedy, anachronistic hairstyles and all. Molina\\'s tormented man-machine is a stunning technical and creative achievement, a terrifying monster who moves with the sinister shudder of an impending earthquake and fights a mostly losing battle with his own mind and body. His weirdly expressive mechanical arms alone have more personality than most human movie characters, but Molina\\'s performance ensures that the man doesn\\'t get lost in the machinery. In that sense, he\\'s a bit like Spider-Man 2 itself: a blockbuster with tremendous emotional resonance, a special-effects extravaganza with soul.. Sam Raimi has once again impressed me whit cinematic style. Spider-Man 2 starts a few years after the first one. we see that ever since taking on the mantle of Spider-Man Peter Parker\\'s life has become a disorganized and depressing this leads him to having inner conflict on whether or not he should remain as Spider-Man or if he should just stay as Peter Parker. We as he audience already know that he is going to stay as Spider-Man it\\'s still cool to watch Peter\\'s evolution. Now the biggest complaint that most people have about his movie is that it is to cheesy and they\\'re right it is cheesy, but all that does is had to charm of the film. Then there\\'s the villain, Doctor Octopus, who is a scientist who went mad after accidentally killing his beloved. Now he is equipped with 4 electronic arms and has plan that could destroy all of New York. This villain is perfect considering that he was a man that wanted to do great things but failed and now has gone mad. Another good part to this movie is the Aunt May who serves a bigger purpose in this movie than last even getting in a few blows on the villain. The only thing missing is that typical Spider-Man charm, with charming banter and wit-full comebacks. In conclusion if you liked the first movie than you\\'ll love this one.. Such a fun movie! I love Spider-Man 2! so much of it! especially that memorable train fight between Spidey and Doc Ock arguably one of the greatest action sequences of all time. Spider - Man 2 was a film in which shoulder a good script and a good performance from our favorite players , the rise , fall and revival of our arachnid superhero.. I really enjoyed the first film, despite its unevenness in the script, and its length. This sequel is almost as good as its predecessor, and for me one of the better sequels out there. If there is one thing that I do prefer over the original, despite the rather slow start, I do think this film has the stronger storyline. The script is in general very good too, but the only other real problem I have with this film is its length. Despite the flaws, it is a pretty darn good action sequel. Two things made this movie as wonderful as it was. One was that it was terrific visually and technically, with splendid special effects and jaw-dropping stunts. The final action sequence between Spiderman and Dr Octopus was in particular brilliantly staged. The cinematography is focused and makes the film even more a wonder to look at. The other was the villain Dr Octopus, superbly played by Alfred Molina. Dr Octopus is made into a rather complex villain, after the death of his wife Rosalie, and becomes a villain after being part of his own invention. The music was also dramatic and fun. The remainder of the performances were very good too, while not admittedly the most charismatic actors ever, (Sean Connery is definitely a contender for that) Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst still give believable lead performances. All in all, a very good sequel. 8/10 Bethany Cox. I love the first two entries of Sam Raimi\\'s Spider-Man movie adaptions! They make me feel all giddy inside! I always loved Tobey Maguire as Spidey! Spider-man 2 is a improvement from the first with even more memorable action sequences and CGI! Spider-Man 1&2 are by far some of the best superhero films of all time.. Spider-Man 2 gives you everything that an action sci-fiction movie should give.If you wanna see the best action scenes of 2004 (or maybe the best of all) with a very strong and touching story,so Spider-Man 2 is your film.. So not only was the game for this title amazing, so was the film. Absolutely loved it. The cast were brilliant and each played vital roles. They portrayed very real, rollercoaster emotions through a great script. Sadness, happiness or just comedy, the film had it all. Alfred Molina as a villain was particularly spectacular. All these wonderful characteristics combined with the sensational action sequences and fantastic musical scoring, made the whole media perhaps one of the most memorable super hero films I\\'ve ever seen. Simply amazing. I\\'d go as far as to say this will be considered and looked back as a classic for the super hero comic book genre in film.. The best adaptation of Spider-Man to ever appear on film and it\\'s easily one of the greatest non MCU films to come out, Tobey Maguire is incredible in this role and you genuinely feel sorry for the guy as he gets bad luck after bad luck and the rest of the cast especially James Franco and J.K Simmons completely own there roles. The story is incredible and shows the struggle that Spider-Man goes through every day trying to balance being a superhero and a student/photographer but he meets a scientist called Otto Octavius played by Alfred Molina (who is amazing in this film) and he is trying to emulate the power of the sun to give unlimited power to everyone in the city. But when the experiment goes wrong and kills his wife and his metal arms that he created to try and contain the miniature sun gets permanently attached to him, and the A.I takes over him and drives him insane and thus the story continues and I won\\'t spoil the movie if you haven\\'t seen it and if you haven\\'t check it out.. Spiderman 2 is fast, action-packed and as full-of-heart as the first, continuing perfectly with its predecessor, with his great plot, awesome story-telling and unforgettable characters to make this film an appropriate sequel.. Muy divertida con uno de los mejores villanos que se han visto. La historia es excelente y los personajes se desenvuelven bien en ella. Así deberían ser las pelis de Spiderman.. Diesen Film werde ich nie vergessen. Bis dato bleibt er für mich der beste Spider-Man Film aller Zeiten. Ich verbinde nicht nur Kindheitserinnerungen mit ihm. Für mich ist er quasi die Erklärung für meine Liebe zum Charakter Spider-Man.Ich war bereits dank Evil Dead ein riesiger Fan von Sam Raimi. Aber dieser Film toppte auch mein geliebtes Armee der Finsternis. Wenn es einen Superhelden-Film gibt, den ich meinen Kindern zeigen werde. Dann ist es dieser!. One of my favourite superhero movies of all time since Captain America triologyThis changed everything and made it a great drama with great characters and a good storyThis is the best Spiderman movie ever made, without doubts. One of the few movies in which the sequel is better than the original. Spider-Man 2 took everything that made the original great and built upon it. The action, effects, and performances are better. The storyline is much more emotional and captivating. It\\'s best live action Spider-Man film that I\\'ve seen so far.. Well wow. It\\'s kind of really late but I watched it over TV and couldn\\'t wait to share my views.Firstly, Toby is my spiderman forever and that\\'s not changing. I remember reading this review http://bit.ly/29smOqf that describes the movie in an apt way. I give it a 8 (2 less cause I didn\\'t like mary jane). Homem-Aranha 2 é um grande marco na história de seu personagem e, também, nos filmes de super-heróis. Maior, melhor e mais complexo que o original, a narrativa desafia os limites de um dito filme de ação e explora os conflitos pessoais de seus personagens, que são mais que meras alegorias.Peter Parker, o protagonista, enfrenta as severas consequências da escolha que fez ao se tornar o Homem-Aranha. Incapaz de equilibrar sua vida dupla, ele se vê obrigado a, cada vez mais, sacrificar sua vida pessoal e acadêmica pelo dever de um herói, perdendo a confiança e a admiração de seus amigos e conhecidos. A complicada vida de Peter é explorada e exposta paulatinamente, tornando-a incrivelmente real e também relacionável.Em meio à crise de identidade de Parker, o renomado e carismático doutor Octo Octavius se prepara para apresentar ao mundo o projeto de sua vida: uma fonte de energia barata e infinitamente renovável que tem como fonte um sol artificial. O antagonista do filme é um cientista dedicado que, porém, vê sua experiência falhar espetacularmente, custando a vida de sua esposa e sua própria sanidade. Otto se deixa dominar por braços mecânicos que construiu para manusear seu \"sol\", tornando-se, oficialmente, um memorável e implacável vilão.Enquanto a nova ameaça, Dr. Octopus, busca reconstruir seu projeto a todo custo, Peter desiste de sua vida dupla, mas percebe que nem tudo é perfeito. O herói encara a realidade e abraça, por uma segunda vez, o dever de ser o Homem-Aranha, sendo também colocado à prova quando Octopus sequestra sua amada para seus próprios fins.O filme conta com batalhas incrivelmente detalhadas e exploradas, como a memorável luta sobre o trem, que culmina em outra cena inesquecível: Parker, incansavelmente, busca parar este mesmo trem a todo custo e salvar a vida de todos os seus passageiros. Octopus é um vilão complexo, ameaçador e também antigo ídolo de Peter, ampliando seu antagonismo.Rumo à conclusão da história, o vilão, recobrando sua consciência, escolhe morrer de forma honrada e destruir sua perigosa criação, um sol auto sustentável, por si só, afogando-a junto consigo em um rio de Nova York. O Homem-Aranha cumpre seu dever mais uma vez e foge com sua amada, que desiste de um casamento em nome de Parker.Por fim, uma trama nova surge: Harry Osborn, até então melhor amigo de Peter, descobre sua dupla identidade e jura vingança pela morte de seu pai, vista no filme original. Osborn descobre, em seguida, a vida dupla de seu pai, deixando para uma sequência controversa a resolução de uma nova história.Homem-Aranha 2 explora ao máximo seus personagens e dá profundidade a todos os seus conflitos, aderindo ao filme um toque de realismo, drama e sensibilidade raramente visto em produções do gênero. Tais feitos o tornam, sem dúvidas, uma das melhores sequências do cinema e também um dos melhores filmes de super-herói já feitos, título que mantém, gloriosamente, até a atualidade.. Really Good Movie, improves on the original, Dock Ock is a really good villain and is the best villain in the Spider-Man Trilogy. Sam Raimai has written a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come. Standing right beside The Dark Knight, its probably better then it as well. Spider-Man 2 is the best super hero film ever. It conducts such a nice tone and such a great plot, great acting, great soundtracks and a great villain that pretty much already makes it the best superhero film. This film shines not because its better then Spider-Man 1. It shines because it can be considered the best superhero film ever. It shines because it shows people the reality of life. It shines because it adapts from Spider-Man 1. The film takes the \"With Great Power comes great Responsibility\" and shows us what it really means. Can peter parker take the responsibility of managing to be spider-man, get a income, provide for his aunt, go to school and try to win the heart of Mary Jane Watson. Adding on top of that his best friend Harry wants vengeance for his fathers death blaming the death on Spider-man. Adding more on top of that Doctor Otto Octavious has gone bad. Adding even more on top of that The Daily Bugle\\'s Jonah Jameson keeps on throwing weight on spider-man calling him a menace. Peter decides he cant take it. He decides that he didn\\'t want to be spider-man, he quits. He goes on to live a regular life, for a while it seems all good and well however it comes to back to strike him as time goes on. As time goes on peter realizes that he cant get away from being spider-man, even when he is being himself he still has a hero in him. He realizes that he is spider-man, whether he wants to be or not. He realizes \"sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing we want most, even our dreams\". This is a quote that speaks to life, that speaks about responsibility. Spider-Man 2 isn\\'t about action or about self-doubt. Its about Responsibility. And that is why it is the best Spider-Man Movie ever, and that is also why it is the best superhero movie too. You might realize its just a story thats dark however sam raimi adds more to the plot. Funny dialogue, the return of JK Simmons. The film is fun, great and even better amazing. Spider-Man 2 is lovely, nostalgic and the best superhero film ever.Verdict: 9.5/10. /    /. Excels the previous showing Peter Parker/SM making the best effort to balancing his dual life and, now, facing a schizophrenic, menacing scientist with mechanical arms: Doctor Octopus. The idea of Spider-Man no more is faithful to ASM #50. The plot is a treat with heart pounding action sequences and one of most saddest death in genre. ¿Why to wait?. In 2019 I start criticizing this film. My situation is that I saw Spiderman at the cinema until \"Far From Home\" of 2019 (in 2019 new armor, new power finally Peter Parker is not very strong ..). For me the best Spiderman are Sam Rami\\'s. He does not create these powers with armor he feels them! In this film, the emotions of Spiderman play tricks on him as for us watching the movie. He can not fight anymore because he can not dream anymore. In this film we talk about a spiderman breaking between love and his power that gives him 2 \"him\". As strange as it sounds, Sam Rami tends to show that living two lives is not the only thing you can do. If you want to succeed, you have to be yourself. May be that after all the message is addressed to the lovers and the gifted passionate fan of adventure waiting for her to look at you in the train .. That\\'s not enough .. Spiderman saves her. This is a super good, entertaining, and fun Spider-Man movie. The acting has improved from the first one for sure. The special effects also got improved, and looked more real. It was also exciting to see what happened next because the story was exciting, fun, dramatic, and new. It is worth a watch.. When a failed nuclear fusion experiment results in an explosion that kills his wife, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) is transformed into Dr. Octopus, a cyborg with deadly metal tentacles. Doc Ock blames Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) for the accident and seeks revenge. Meanwhile, Spidey\\'s alter ego, Peter Parker, faces fading powers and self-doubt. Complicating matters are his best friend\\'s (James Franco) hatred for Spider-Man and his true love\\'s (Kirsten Dunst) sudden engagement to another man.. Spider-man 2 has the perfect blend of character building and action in a comic book movie. It perfectly blends the believable struggle Peter has between his normal life and his superhero life. The themes fit so well that it can feel like you\\'re watching a real, personal struggle.. Spider-Man 2. The main threat hidden under the mask is back. This is the title of a movie that has Jonah Jameson in it. The sequel looks even nicer. The plot is not so straightforward, and the main villain attracts all the attention.. It alright, these films do not hold up well at all but it\\'s still good, instead of going in depth I\\'m just gonna make points. Cheesy, decent pacing, good action scenes, people are **** in this film (Mary Jane, Aunt May etc.) I would say more, but I\\'m tired.. 2022 rewatch I still don\\'t get the durability of Doc Ock. Green Goblin had like a super soldier formula inside him. Doc Oct body is still only on a regular human level even if has an impressive cybernetic frame. A hit from Spider Man should cripple this villain\\'s human body. To enjoy this I have to leave my brain at door. Though I have warmed to this movie over years due to the current wave of dire stage four MCU.. This movie is the predictable sequel to the 2002 Spider-Man movie. In this movie, we continue to follow the life of young Peter Parker and his difficulties to reconcile two distinct lives: the masked avenger and the ordinary common guy. The movie is good, has an interesting story and shows a much more human, insecure and teenage Spider-Man than in other films of this superhero, which can be seen as a breath of fresh air in the character.I understand those who say they didn\\'t like the way the main character was thought of in this trilogy. It is something that somehow breaks with the stylized and artificial image of the superhero. It makes perfect sense, though: Peter Parker may have superpowers, but he\\'s still a teenager, a young adult, whatever you want to call it. The action and fighting scenes between heroes and villains are there and the villain is, as in the first movie, the fruit of an accident during a scientific experiment that failed due to his own ego. There is a certain notion of karma here: the villain was not born villain nor is it necessarily and entirely bad, but it is the result of the bad choices he made earlier. His personality, as a villain, is the same as before, but his defects are enhanced and amplified by the powers he has acquired.Problems or defects? Yes, they exist. For starters, the movie wastes more time in unnecessary and accessory scenes than its predecessor. I felt that at times the movie is too long, and that slows the pace a bit. I also found the whole plot strongly predictable. Half an hour before things happened I was mentally anticipating them.Tobey Maguire, you still seem quite satisfactory to me as Spider-Man. He knows how to be a hero without leaving out his more human side. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco were also able to keep up with the work done on the first film and, if they didn\\'t get better, they didn\\'t get worse either. Alfred Molina, who gave life to the villain, Dr. Octopus, surprised me by not expecting to see this actor playing this kind of character.Technically, the movie didn\\'t surprise me. I think it has improved a lot in terms of visual effects and CGI when compared to the first movie, and there are some really well filmed scenes. But that is essentially it. The soundtrack is regular, but I\\'m not even able to hear that \"Spiderman\" song without immediately thinking about \"Spider Pig\" and Homer Simpson. It\\'s stronger than me!. Spider-Man 2 will always be the best Spider-Man film ever! It shows the struggles Peter must go through as both himself and his alter ego. For example, when Peter must go to his best friend\\'s birthday party then BOOM! A huge bank heist occurs and keeping innocents hostage. Peter tries to be both as best as possible, but he has a choice.. Homem Aranha 2 é definitivamente o melhor filme do Homem Aranha,praticamente TUDO funciona.Peter Parker está com problemas em equilibrar sua vida,e depois de problemas e mais problemas atingirem sua vida,ele abandona o manto de Homem Aranha,acredito que todos já saibam que é uma adaptação da HQ \"Spider-man no more\" ,o filme consegue te emocionar,consegue fazer você ficar na ponta da cadeira nas cenas de ação,consegue te deixar com pena do protagonista,consegue mostrar a você quem o Homem Aranha é,um cara que vai tirar forças de não sei aonde para salvar a vida de quem for,a cena do trem é muito memorável,consegue mostrar que pra ser o Homem Aranha é preciso MUITO mais do que contar piadinhas,consegue marcar você,ainda mais com os discursos da Tia May,que são simplesmente PERFEITOS,enfim,simplesmente perfeito.. A bit overrated... It\\'s hundred percent sure that it\\'s the best Spider Man film, but it still has some problems. Perfect Villain and perfect action scenes, with almost perfect story will make you a fan of Spider Man. However, I don\\'t think it deserves better score than The Dark Knight or The Shawshank Redemption.. Spider-Man 2 greatly improves upon the first, with much better CGI, a better story, and more unexpected plot twists. Sequels rarely are better than the first, but Spider-Man 2 definitely blew me away.. A top 3 Spider-Man movie for sure. Great actor performances and and amazing story. Soundtrack is also legendary. Sometimes the pacing is a bit too slow and the villain feels a bit dull even though he has a decent backstory and character.. It was a bit better than the first movie, actually, my favorite movie in this series, because it\\'s more than Spiderman\\'s heroism,human side and in fact, we\\'re watching Peter Parker\\'s life in this movie my favorite part is whether it\\'s a normal life or a spiderman that\\'s the choice finally making the right decision.I think the best villian Doctor Oktopus I like the movie. The best spiderman movie! Better action and story and a rare sequel that is better than the first. The best movie in comics, there are no flaws, I recommend everyone to watch. The main advantages are actors, graphics, plot.. Spider-Man 2 is THE BEST movie I\\'ve ever seen, it is a ton of fun watching Spidey battle Doc Ock while at the same time seeing him struggle with being a normal man, this movie really destroys Peter Parker, he loses his best friend and the love of his life in one movie. It is so nice to get to know the man behind the mask and see him cope with every day life while trying to be Spider-Man. The ending is so satisfying as the whole movie builds up to that point. Spider-Man 2 isn\\'t full of action scenes like the previous movie, it focuses on the emotions of Peter Parker and his struggles. As a result this movie isn\\'t for everyone. For me this movie is the best super hero movie of all time as well as the best movie of all time. This movie definitely deserves a 10/10.. The best Super-hero movie to date.This movie and Into the Spider-verse are two best Spider-man movies.. The set pieces, such as an unmasked Spider-Man trying to stop a runaway subway car, are furiously scary, and compensate for all the icky mooning and moping that Peter does whenever he\\'s questioning his gift, which is most of the time.. This movie is easily the best comic book movie ever. The film excels on character development and the theme. The character development has a tremendous emotional feel to it. Parker loses his powers from the stress of the tasks of Spider-Man conflicting with Parker\\'s social life whether it\\'s school or the relationships with his friends and family. He regained his powers by reconnecting those relationships, improving his grades, and yet still chooses to be Spider-Man. The theme relates very well to the character development which is, \"Choice.\" Our choices have consequences whether for good or for bad. I could go on and on, but it\\'d be too long. Every aspect of this movie, from emotion, comedy, darkness, and action, does great and still holds to this day a fantastic film.. Wow. Sequels should be the other way around! They\\'re never supposed to be this good, but whatever. It was enjoyable at times.. Homem Aranha 2 é um dos melhores filmes de heróis já feitos, e é obrigatório para quem é fan do tema.Apesar de ser livre para todos os públicos, Spider-Man 2 traz um \"subcontexto\" melancólico e que só será notado por quem for mais maduro. Ao redor do filme, o diretor faz questão de deixar na cara que mesmo sendo um herói, os problemas da vida batem. Na realidade, batem mais forte do que nunca. Após todos os traumas e uma transição entre a vida normal e a de herói, que não é/foi nada saudável, o personagem não se encontra, se mostrando indeciso em diversos momentos, o que acaba por afetar seus próprios poderes. Outra sacada interessante foi a do próprio Dr. Octopus, que além de dar muito trabalho, foge do estereotipo de \"ser do mal\", e se torna uma vitima das suas próprias ambições.As cenas de luta do filme são memoráveis e nos deixam ansiosos, que junto com a trilha sonora, faz com que fiquemos na ponta da cadeira. Também há momentos com um apelo dramático relacionado a como as pessoas de bem - não alienadas, o vê, que é deveras linda, e outros alívios cômicos que ajudam muito a quebrar o clima tenso do filme, evitando que ele seja pesado o tempo inteiro. Nota 9!. Sam Raimi\\'s second Spider-Man movie is undeniably an improvement upon the original. It\\'s villain was compelling. The action scenes were better and the story was thought-provoking. This is without a doubt the best of Sam Raimi\\'s Spider-Man trilogy. The greatest blockbuster ever made thanks to an excellent script by the late great multiple-time Oscar-winning Alvin Sargent, simply beautiful cinematography by Bill Pope and endlessly creative, inventive and exhilarating direction by Sam Raimi.. This is the Spider-Man we deserve, the only movie that can bring justice to the character. The best version of Spider-Man. Everything about this film is exactly how Spider-Man was written, Doctor Octopus was amazing in this movie, the chemistry between Tobey & Alfred is so spot on. The best Spider-Man movie ever!!! Tobey did a fantastic job as Spider-Man/Peter Parker, just fantastic. This movie is so underrated, & with people giving it a 7.3/10 are wrong, it should be higher because this is how films are made & characters. At least this film is Marvel\\'s best since The Winter Solider & Infinity War, by far Marvel\\'s golden age at the time until now. I miss movies like these, we don\\'t usually get these stuff anymore which is sad, but Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse did great, & thats my second favorite Spider-Man movie. Spider-Man 2 brings the exciting moment of history of Spider-Man. It\\'s a fantastic film, & most people don\\'t realize that. Thank you Sam Raimi & Tobey Maguire & Stan Lee for bringing this movie to life as the best Spider-Man film ever!!!!!!!Summary: The Best Spider-Man movie ever!!!. Its a good movie as well s being a good spider man movie. However i couldnt sit through it because it was so boring.. what do you want me to say..... great just wanted to give this beauty a 10.. The most comic book movie of it time! I know the fact that Sam Raimi basically wrote the same movie three times, but all of Alfred Molina\\'s scenes are completely worth it! So many terrific action scenes that it\\'s probably the last time you could call a SONY pictures film downright generous. I haven\\'t seen the third film, so expect that to be on my watch list soon.. Eu preciso falar que esse é o melhor filme do aranha?! Ou todo mundo ja sabe disso?!Filme maravilhoso que consegue fazer tudo no equilibrio... comdia certa, açao certa, trama certa, e drama certo.Esse filme é uma OBRA PRIMA!!!Recomendo e muuuuuuuiiiiitooooo. Still the best live action spider-man movie.A Masterpiece, compared to the MCU Spider-Boy movies.... Spider-man 2 is one of my favorite movies of all timeeeeeee also one of the best movies made everrrrr ik recently it\\'s been lower on people\\'s list which is a crime but this is my review so yes I grew up with these movies for sure and I don\\'t just go it\\'s the best because of that I\\'ll like it but this movie I absolutely it is tied with the batman right now of my favorite film of all time I have no flaws in this movie zero yes mary Jan Wattson I just don\\'t like I like her when she invites Peter to I believe get lunch she\\'s talking about if he loves her than a flying car comes which I love this scene from peter and mary jane Wattson and I love the story with losing his powers like you know if any spider-man movie did this I believe most of people would hate it now definitely tom holland because it\\'s from his suits, not his body but in this movie, peter is struggling with balancing out being spider-man and being peter park and sam rami is just a genius like why can we not have another movie man i just love his vision in this movie i can see his vision and what everyone wanted in this movie like my god i just love it the fight scenes on the train as well like my god what!!! how did they do this in 2004 but we go to no way home and it\\'s all CGI like disgusting I still love no way home but still practical makes the movie so much more realistic and better just by practical the score is the best in this where he gets his suit back and he is swinging to the clock tower before they start fighting on the train harry in this where he now figures out peter is spider-man around the ending and the music and the laugh of goblin before marry jane walks out on her other boyfriend my god I love that scene get chills every time that plays. Doc Ock is an amazing villain I believe he is my second fav idk yet but yes he is perfect I like the way where he accidentally kills his wife and doesn\\'t want to do it anymore but the arms take control but all-round spider-man 2 is one of the best movies till this date I haven\\'t seen a spider-man beat this almost with no way home but this movie has everything about it perfect which is very hard to top I give Spider-Man 2 an A+ 100%. Spider-man 2 is not only the perfect sequel, but the perfect superhero movie. The development of not only spider-man, but Peter Parker is also established as a major plot point that allows for the viewer to relate to Parker as another broke college student.. Sony did a great job of focusing on what really matters in this movie - the character. Here we see a relatable Peter Parker who can\\'t seem to catch a break and when he does it just feels so satisfying to watch him rise up from all the challenges he faced.. Is it me or does MJ get more and more annoying with every film? Still a 10/10 film for me because I\\'m not here for her, I\\'m here for my boy, Peter Parker!. Had high hopes for this one because of the first film. Was not disappointed!. I was completely blown away! The 11-year-old in me definitely connected with this film on another level and made me remember just how much I loved superheroes.. You can definitely feel the effort that the studio put into every scene in the movie.. Best Spider-Man Movie Ever Made.One of the best comic book movies.Very Good Script.Musics and Acting.This Movie Gives You A Peter Parker Story Than Spider-Man.And I Love This.Best Marvel Movie Ever Made. I\\'ve read the comics and I can say that this is truly the comic book come to life!. Wanna see what a flawless film looks like? Go see this one now! You will not be disappointed.. Alfred Molina delivered a top performance in this film! Even with the short screen time, he made such a great impact on the overall quality of the movie.. Here in this movie, we see more of the human side of Spider-Man and saw how this boy turned into a man trying his best to fulfill his responsibilities being a human and superhero at the same time.. To sum it up, this is the first Spider-Man film with everything leveled up.. I really, really appreciate that they highlight character development and storyline more than the fight scenes.. All the action, comedy, and drama had such a delicate balance. It\\'s pretty amazing to see such a precise blend of these emotions in a superhero film.. Not only did they have great storytelling and scriptwriting, but they also had amazing actors as well! They definitely brought so much emotions out of every scene.. Never have I seen so much realism in a film, let alone a superhero film. Amazing director!. Read the comic book and you\\'ll appreciate more how they stayed true to the book!. The best comic book movie ever made. Sure, we have Nolan trilogy or other deeds here, but Sam Raimi\\'s spider man has something the others don\\'t. Heart. It can be outrageously seen in the film that the crew enjoyed the filming and they no longer stayed as close to the ground as in the first part.. Sam Raimi’s sequel is everything you wanted in a Spider-Man film, and more. A bland of emotion, thrilling action, soul and humor in one of the most iconic films in the genre.. Best superhero movie of all time. Nothing comes even close. For me Tobey Maguire is the real spiderman. This is the best spider-man movie and one of the best superhero movies ever.. Probably one of the greatest comic book films of all time, from the cinematography to the story telling. It’s absolutely fantastic. O filme tem ótimos efeitos especiais, basicamente todas as atuações são boas, lutas bem coreografadas, trilha sonora perfeita e um dos melhores vilões do Homem-Aranha.O único problema que eu diria seria o amor deles, que ainda não me convencem muito não.. An absolutely stellar film that has stood the test of time wonderfully. Still the best Spider-man film of all time (and yes, I\\'m including Into The Spider-Verse in that reckoning), and one of the best superhero films period, surpassed only by Logan and The Dark Knight in my opinion. It\\'s not perfect, but it\\'s damn close.The cast is wonderful, with Maguire, Dunst and Franco all having improved enormously since the last film, and Alfred Molina giving one of the all time great super villain portrayals in Doc Ock. And of course, who could forget the definitive J. Jonah Jameson, J. K. Simmons. The script is excellent, popping with wit and humour, and carrying the films more emotional scenes admirably. Danny Elfman\\'s score perfectly encapsulates the feel of a spider scuttling along it\\'s web, Sam Raimi\\'s direction is creative and extremely engaging (especially during the first class action scenes and that one hospital scene I won\\'t spoil for those who haven\\'t seen it), and the many references to classic Spider-man stories, other Marvel properties or other films entirely, be they in the form a commemorative shot or a quick gag, are very pleasing. Additionally, despite being more than 15 years old now, the majority of the visual effects and CGI have aged beautifully, rivalling much of what we see today. No wonder it won an Academy Award for its work in that field back in 2004.As I said, it isn\\'t perfect. Much like its predecessor and successor, it can be a little overly cheesy at times, and some of the visual effects don\\'t hold up so well these days (again, most of them are still stellar). All in all, this film deserves its formidable reputation, and I doubt it will ever be topped in the field of cinema.. I found the wish-wash from Peter throughout this movie slightly annoying/childish. The Peter Parker dialog wasn\\'t quite the same brand of goofy as 1. And to top it off, a good chunk of the camp is lost in favor of a more serious arc for Doc Ock. Alfred Molina\\'s performance is wonderful, but not quite as good as I remembered it. There just wasn\\'t that many beats to warrant all of the praise I hear for this performance. If I\\'m being honest, I think it only stands slightly above Franco\\'s. ALL THAT SAID, this is one hell of a fun movie and still easily head and shoulders above ASM. The cafe scene and the train scene are iconic for a reason and any future Doc Ock will still have a lot to live up to compared to Molina. My main gripe is that I just had a lot less fun watching this movie than I did with the first in the series. The camp is still there, but its dulled a bit and I felt the relationships between characters and the fluctuations those relationships experienced to be less impactful than 1.. Spider-Man 2 may be called a comic book movie, but is so much more than that. The film improves the action thanks to a larger budget, has awesome acting and characters, and an excellent script which has a heart and entertains. Spider-Man 2 is a movi. Improves on the first one by a ton although the acting and casting are still wooden.. there are a lot of issues with Spiderman 2(forewarning I do enjoy the Tobey Trilogy, but it\\'s not a perfect and not as good as I remember it). Tobey and Dunst offer the same bland acting of love interests that they did in the first movie. It doesn\\'t feel like natural chemistry. It feels forced and pales in comparison to the on screen chemistry of Garfield and Stone, who felt like they were genuinely falling for each other and Gwen actually could back Spidey up in terms of a combat situation. Mary Jane is portrayed in the comics as a more daring and powerful female counterpart to Peter, and in the movies Dunst plays a half assed MJ who keeps getting caught and basically is a person for Spidey to save, more  there to move the plot not for anything else. Secondly the entire arc of losing his powers was an interesting concept to follow sorta an ESB for the Spiderman universe, but the whole playing of him losing powers is not only rushed, but lacks motive and while I can see it building character to Tobey both as peter and Spidey, it falls flat on it\\'s face when MJ the previously mentioned basic damsel in distress getting taken by Doc Ock, which basically implies that Peter\\'s whole motive to be Spiderman is MJ and literally destroys any character building Raimi intended. I compare this to ESB because there is the is the clear motive of showing the fall of the hero, followed by the rise, but it all happens in one movie and that makes it extremely rushed and unclear. Thirdly this movie is played out by the fanbase to be considered better than the first movie, I\\'d argue that the first movie is better in terms of character development, but the issues still stand that there is forced dialogue, failed chemistry and overall it\\'s not the juggernaut of the movie portray it to be.. Spider-Man 2 is a legendary sequel. The story is excellent again, and of course the delicious soundtrack plays into that, which is simply not wrong. Of course, the action is also excellent and there is even one scene that I consider one of the best action scenes in superhero films ever. The negative Octopus also does an excellent job here and overall it is an excellent film.. Мой любимый фильм детства! Сколько раз его не пересматривал, ни разу не разочаровался ни в чём. Визуально, даже сегодня смотрится вполне приемлемо.. You don\\'t often see this, a sequel that actually improved over the first one, and did things that the first didn\\'t, while also not straying away too far from the original. У фильма такие же проблемы как и у первого во первых силы куда-то пропадают и Мэри Джейн прошманда женится на одном любит другого.. An excellent sequel that is just as smart, well paced, and action packed as the original.Molina is inspired casting as the main antagonist.. This is a movie I rarely watch a lot but despite some flaws I really enjoyed. I really love the nod to the Spider-Man No More arc. I really like how it showed Peter\\'s struggles and how everything doesn\\'t go his way.. rewelacyjne superhero i najlepsza część trylogii Raimiego. Podejmuje ważny temat co to znaczy i z czym wiąże się bycie superbohaterem. I do tego ten Doc Ock. this movie is one of the best movies from 2004 along with shrek 2 and the incredibles!. Warning for all three of these movies: If you don\\'t like the cheesiness of them, you won\\'t enjoy them at all.Great follow-up. Extra cheese.. best Spider-Man and marvel movie. This is my favorite movie along TDK. You don\\'t see a movie like this these days. Spider-Man 2 is the perfect representation of the character.Peter Parker Feels Human, he struggles, he loses the girl, loses his friend, disapoints aunt may, the man is broke and in the end of the day he always chooses to do the right thing.This movie shapes whole super hero movie industrie.The movie is so good not because of the action scenes and stuff like that, it´s beacuse the \"spider-man 2\" is a movie about people, what makes the ordinary look extraordinary.When peter parker Succeeds, Spider-Man fails, When Spider-Man succesd Peter fails, but the dude just don´t give up doing the right thing, and that´s what i call a perfect Spider-Man movie.. The characters are incredibly fleshed out with top-notch performances. This is by far the most comic-accurate Spider-Man film, and you could tell that Sam Raimi really understands the character of Spider-Man. The choreography was also impressive, especially the train fight scene. Alfred Molina as Doc Ock is still one of the best comic book villains. Spider-Man 2 is still one of the best comic book movies and a definite must-see.. Spider-Man 2 does the impossible, crafting a sequel that is more action-packed than the first while still holding onto the heart and soul of the drama.. Great insight into the characters, their relationships and the protagonist himself that we see in all his frailties. Second chapter of the trilogy which is clearly the best of the three films. Excellent editing, excellent direction for this film which is faster, shrewd and more technical than the first. But, perhaps, even more profound, both in terms of content and cinematic content.. This is just the best Spider Man movie of all time (Of course don\\'t counting NWH), it us a beautiful movie, amazing CGI\\'s, perfect history, so nostalgic, one of the best super hero movies of all time, if you don\\'t watched yet, just watch, it\\'s amazing.. I don’t care what anyone says but this is the best Spider-Man movie of all time.. ---------------------------------10.0/10-----------------------------------. I watched a long time ago and I had a conflict about this film, I couldn\\'t understand why Spider-Man 2 was considered one of the best superhero movie ever. I\\'ll be honest, I was a kid and I didn\\'t process the film like this days, that doesn\\'t mean that the film didn\\'t like in that moment. Now days, I get on the train to swear that Spider-Man 2 is the best Marvel film ever.It\\'s an amazing mix of genre which has you on the edge of your sit during all the film. It\\'ll thrill you, it\\'ll make you sad, it\\'ll amuse you, it\\'ll make you jump out of your seat in excitement. It could be said that I am exaggerating but this film is perfect in every single aspect, the script, directing, cinematography, visual effects, the performances, editing, sound and soundtrack, achieving an unique style to be the benchmark talking about Spider-Man.It squeezes all your feelings while with a gorgeous eloquence speaks us about the importance of kindness above all. It could be summarized with great tenderness with the next verse.\"I believe there\\'s a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble and finally allows us to die with pride. Even though sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing that we want the most. Even our dreams\". Better then the first still also one of the best if not the best superhero movie of all time.. Seeing this movie after No Way Home is very refreshing. It easily brings back memories to my childhood.. After watching No Way Home it is hard for me to say which live action Spider-Man movie is better. But, honestly I personally think Spider-Man 2 is still the best Spider-Man movie as it is a movie that really understands it’s hero.. The characters are so well fleshed out. And the story and theme are all so well done:. Possibly the best Sam Raimi movie, arguably the best comic book movie.Great characters, incredible cinematography (all of the Sam Raimi sweeps and Dutch angles are present), and an iconic villain in Alfred Molina.If you haven’t seen it, go watch it, and keep your eyes out for the hospital scene. You’ll know which one I’m talking about when you do.. DC has The Dark Knight, and Marvel has Spider-Man 2. This movie is a cinematic masterpiece, and is easily top 3 best comic book movies of all time.. A lot of people call this a perfect sequel and I agree with them, it is a perfect sequel. It takes everything we had in Spider-Man and doubles it. There\\'s suspense, action and everything you would want in a Spider-Man Movie. The only thing I wasn\\'t on board with was when Spider-Man loses his powers. But other then that, a amazing movie!. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssssssstttttttttttteeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrppppppppppiiiiiiiiieeeeeeecccccccccceeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!. This is not only the best Spider-Man film but also one of the best superhero films of all time! After all of these years and many new Spider-Man films, I still don’t think any has quite managed to get to this level of sheer awesomeness!!!!. Man the writing in this movie is just so good. All the characters are well fleshed out, and the emotions are all well earned.. Still to this day easily one of the greatest all time comic book movies ever made.. Gsjiwjdhdhwjwkwjebkwkwjdkeoqiegjeowueheieohwhwodieviwowhwhdkivhdhwoqidvwjowhwhri. Jsowpaisjkwlqpqpqowowopwpwisjndnf amazing movie this is and it was just too good.. This is a classic, definitely my favorite Sam Raimi Spider-Man movie, better than the first in every way possible, more action, better characters and pretty good writing.. What an amazing movie this was!. IT is nice to see how responsible and lofty Peter is. Firstly the film showed us that Peter Parker is just a normal person identical to all of us he has his own life own private relationship until he got that power it plays a considerable role in his life at some point it might miserable the loss make him stronger and loftier  because he understood what loss gonna like. Still the best superhero movie in existence!. The train fight scene alone is better then the whole MCU, fact not a opinion.. Um dos melhores filmes que já assisti. Nunca enjôo. Sempre tem a sensação nostálgica. This was the best Spider-Man movie until Spiderman No Way Home came out. This movie still holds up very well.. ___________________________________ 10/10_________________________________________________________. Hdoaisjdjsjowowkwjqjwoksjdjwowojdjfjfjroeojsjqoqoqisjdmdkwokwmdmdkwoe10/10. Still to this day one of the greatest movies of all time. This movie is a masterpiece!. Best Spider-Man movie ever if only NWH didn\\'t come out. But seriously this movie was incredible.. 4th best Marvel movie ever made. Still holds up very well and is a great and inspiring movie.. Still to this day one of the best superhero movies ever made, as it was a masterpiece.. This is not only top 3 best comic book movies of all time, but also one of the best superhero movies ever made.. Spider-Man 2 is the best Spider-Man movie ever made until No Way Home came out.. Still holds up very well and is most definitely still one of the all-time greatest comic book movies ever made.. One of the best comic book movies ever made without a doubt. It was better than the first by a longshot.. Second best Spider-Man movie of all time right behind Spider-Man No Way Home. Very iconic and holds up very well.. Still the best Spider-Man movie. Imo it is better then all of the MCU. Second best marvel movie imo.. Watch the movie. It is so good with very good story and themes presented. It is also very enjoyable..

Oh man I really really love this movie so much, it is the second best Marvel movie ever made and easily one of the greatest movies of all time..

And the story and themes were great.. 17 years later and this movie still holds up very fine, still a lot of fun to watch.. It’s still one of the best superhero movies ever made almost 18 years later.. The best Marvel movie ever made right behind NWH. It was just way too good for the MCU and is a masterpiece.. The movie has such good writing, and holds up very well. Second best Spider-Man movie eve made.. The more I rewatch this movie the better and better it gets. It\\'s just that good.. Spider-Man 2 may be called a comic book movie, but is so much more than that. The film improves the action thanks to a larger budget, has awesome acting and characters, and an excellent script which has a heart and entertains. Spider-Man 2 is a movie you truly have to see to believe, it is the master of comic book movies along with The Dark Knight. Even if you are not a Spider-Man fan, SEE THIS MOVIE!. Personally out of the three Spider-Man movies in Sam Raimi\\'s trilogy, this is the one I was the least interested in. It wasn\\'t introducing Spider-Man for the first time like Spider-Man 1, nor did it have all the villains I knew like Spider-Man 3. In fact I didn\\'t even knew who Doctor Octopus was before watching this movie. And seeing him as a fat man with tentacles didn\\'t help either. So I had watched it from a reluctant point of view, only to start liking it by the end.In the beginning it is established that no matter how many powers Peter gets, it won\\'t change the fact that people still see him as a nerd, which is something that happens in the comics too. And this time he has a lot more interaction with his best friend Harry. They are shown to be really good friends, until it is revealed that Spider-Man was the one who killed his father. And instead of justifying that Green Goblin died of his own fault, Peter didn\\'t make any excuses and just told Harry that there are more important matters to attend. This shows how Spider-Man understands his responsibilities as a superhero, something that Uncle Ben had taught him very well before his death.Later on Peter is completely depressed and he loses all his superpowers. He embraces back to his nerd self, but doesn\\'t hesitate from playing hero again when he sees a building on fire. He can\\'t see anyone suffering any longer now that he has played a hero for so long. This is also established when he sees a couple of goons beating up someone in broad daylight and no one comes to help him. Finally Peter decides to go back to being Spider-Man and steals the costume that JJ had kept in his office.Doc Oc is also another great character. I had seen him with an absolute blank slate, so I didn\\'t have any kind of expectation from him. And yet he surprised me. Someone who doesn\\'t want to be the bad guy but is slowly turning into one because his mind is not under his control. I was expecting Spider-Man to beat some sense into him the way he was doing in the train fight scene. But Spider-Man decided to do the absolutely right thing by talking him out of it and helping him gain back control over his senses. This is something I could only expect from Spider-Man. If it were someone like Iron Man or Batman he would have simply beaten him up till the machines stopped working. And that\\'s exactly what sets Spider-Man apart from the other superheroes.And finally we have the ending, where Peter and Mary are shown to have a happy ending while Harry is grieving over the fact that his best friend murdered his father. And when he discovers his father\\'s secret lab he knows what to do. Spider-Man trilogy is a perfect trilogy and I really like how this movie bridges Peter Parker from being a high school nerd to one of the greatest superheroes of all time.. Easily the best and most relatable superhero in existence. The story and the production of this film is highly competent.. Second best superhero movie of all time right behind NWH in my opinion. Such a great story.. Such a amazing movie with a great story, great themes and the movie has tons of heart.. This movie is still a masterpiece almost 18 years later and will always be a. This is still the best Spider-Man movie ever made to date in my opinion. Too good.. This movie in my opinion was better then every MCU movie with the exception of NWH.. This is imo the 4th best superhero movie behind NWH, Infinity War, and TDK.. Superhero cinema peaked in 2004 when this came out. Not only did Sam Raimi make a sequel better than the original, he also made the greatest comic book movie to this date. It has great shots, acting, a great story, themes, and visuals. Everything about Doc Ock is perfect. And somehow everything about Peter and his arc is even more perfect.. This movie was so well written with a very well thought out story and themes well presented.. Not only is it better then the first Spider-Man movie, but is the second best Spider-Man movie behind NWH.. In my opinion this is the 3rd best superhero movie ever made behind TDK and NWH.. After literally 17 years, this movie is still a masterpiece to this day, Raimi is so good.. Movie was great and that’s it not gonna say anything but go and watch the movie.. This movie is slightly worse the No Way Home in my opinion, but man this movie still holds up very very well.. Hdbsbshohwfwhakwgqgwjwkdhfbjdkwjqgsgsjwjwhhskfhrvdvnfjgotpqiqgqgrifodjbwnwjd. I still to this day really adore the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies. As almost two decades later they hold up very well.. Best superhero movie ever!!!!!. Truly amazing. Well written and shows how human Peter is. That is why people like Peter Parker, he\\'s  a relatable guy. The cast was perfect and if I had the time, I would probably watch it over and over again.. The move to this day still holds up incredibly well. This movie has great production and really great writing.. this is some good stuff right here. My favorite superhero film, probably forever, and the most absurd is, I can\\'t totally explain, why. It has an unrepeatable charm, great performances, a unique approach to the daily life problems of superheroes, and...really, just, a great CHARM.. Spider-Man 2: This is a movie that surpasses the original one on many different levels! It has a better villain, a better story and, most of all, a better message. The movie is about Peter Parker who loses faith in what he does, so he loses his powers. Tobey Maguire is magnificent in this movie and he plays so well of all the other actors in the movie. Alfred Molina is great as Doctor Octopus as the new villain, and, always, J.K. Simmons steal every single scene in which he is present. This is really one of the best superhero movies that has ever been made. Another Excellent Superhero Movie. Overall, Outstanding Sequel.. Spider-Man 2 was one of the biggest selling movies of 2004 and I can\\'t forget the day when it first came out and I kept begging my grandma to go see it with me. Till this day I still think is a great movie and I like it cuz it\\'s a classic and It has great views. I love all the action scenes. This movie is still my favorite then the reboot films. Tobey Maguire was a way better spiderman. And i gave this film an A For awesome performance and good acting. Still the best Spider-Man movie to this day. Tobey Maguire is the GOAT at Spider-Man.. The trend of amazing Spider-Man movies continues with a sequel. The 2nd movie is just as good as the 1st. I love Doc Ock a little more than the Green Goblin. Peter doesn\\'t have as good of a connection to this villain as much as the first one, primarily because he didn\\'t know who Doc Ock was that much until he became a villain. He did go the farthest to destroying New York. He built a machine that was near impossible to defeat, and then got stopped the first time just by pulling the plug. The second time was a lot harder because it had to be pulled into the river. I loved the train fight scene when Peter had to stop the train from crashing off the end of the tracks after Doc Ock accelerated it to a higher speed. He thankfully stopped it at the last moment. I also loved how Doc Ock got the robot arms that pretty much made him a cyborg. He was originally a nice guy that seemed to obsessed with machines, but let his instincts take over. Harry even made a deal with him about powering the second machine, and he discovers the his best friend is Spider-Man, the guy he suspects killed his father. This movie is about the same as the first one to me, but still amazing, so go watch if you haven\\'t!. Truly an amazing Spider-Man film. I finally saw this film after all of the praise I\\'ve seen for it, and it was incredible. This is such a strong sequel. It gave everything that we loved about the first film, but even more of it. I really liked Doc Ock! He was so cool! This really showed Peter\\'s development even more, struggling to balance being a superhero and also a college student. I liked the lessons this film had as well! I\\'m glad I finally watched Tobey\\'s spiderman films :). I personally love all Raimi Spider-Man films but this one is just the absolute best. The storytelling is perfect and very well executed. The characters are very entertaining and each one has a very understandable reason for their actions. This is probably the best superhero movie I\\'ve ever seen and it\\'s also one of the best movies I\\'ve ever seen. Honestly, I think this is better than The Dark Knight. Strongly recommend this to people who love Marvel and Superhero Movies in general.. Just rewatching in 2020I was a kid when I watched this in cinema back in 2004 I just want to say after all these years after a few version of Spider-Mans and all the MCU movie. This one is hands down the best Superhero movie. It has everything done within 2 hours. Perfectly caught up what it left of from the previous Spider-Man and Toby Maguire will always be my Spider-Man.. Pizza Time!. Until Spider-Man: No Way Home came out this was the best superhero movie ever made.. Spider-Man 2 was one of the biggest selling movies of 2004 and I can\\'t forget the day when it first came out and I kept begging my grandma to go see it with me. Till this day I still think is a great movie and I like it cuz it\\'s a classic and It has great views. I love all the action scenes. This movie is still my favorite than the reboot films. Tobey Maguire was a way better spiderman. And I gave this film an A For awesome performance and good acting.. Go watch this movie right nowThis movie it\\'s not just a good superhero movie, but a great film. The source material has been analyzed and overall studied so It would make the fans happy, but a great superhero movie understands that this is not just for the fans, It\\'s for the whole public, so the screenplay and the dialogue that sometimes sounds a little corny is very well writen. The CGI effects still looking good at this point, watching Spider-Man swinging around it\\'s just amazing. Peter Parker\\'s story arc it\\'s perfect, for the people he interacts with he is just another nerdy guy who doesn\\'t understand the meaning of punctuality, but for us (the audience) he is the perfect protagonist. This movie is made by someone who understands the character and understands cinema, and that man is Sam Raimi. It\\'s better than all MCU movies except maybe NWH.. Spider-Man 2: This is a movie that surpasses the original one on many different levels! It has a better villain, a better story and, most of all, a better message. The movie is about Peter Parker who loses faith in what he does, so he loses his powers. Tobey Maguire is magnificent in this movie and he plays so well of all the other actors in the movie. Alfred Molina is great as Doctor Octopus as the new villain, and, always, J.K. Simmons steal every single scene in which he is present. This is really one of the best superhero movies that has ever been made. Another Excellent Superhero Movie. Overall, Outstanding Sequel.. LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLlllLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL. This is the best Spider-Man movie ever in my opinion. This movie has the best live-action portrayal of Peter Parker and perfectly displays that behind the mask is a man struggling with everyday issues. It\\'s a movie with a flawed hero who has problems like everyone else, which was Stan Lee\\'s initial intent of the character. He\\'s always late for work, he doesn\\'t have the girl he wants, his aunt is getting evicted from Peter\\'s childhood home, his best friend hates him now, and he\\'s forced to live in a rundown apartment because that\\'s all that his paycheck. All the stress and pain in his life is causing his superhuman abilities to fluctuate. Things get even worse for Peter when Dr. Otto Octavius is transformed into Dr. Octopus, and blames Spider-Man for the accident and seeks revenge. Spider-Man 2 is a perfect display of a week in the life of Peter Parker. The week is framed from the creation and fall of Dr. Octopus, but it\\'s main focus is on the life and troubles of Peter Parker. His life is first, the (solid) plot is a secondary focus. The acting and characters are great, though Mary Jane is annoying at times. The special effects and CGI aged really well, albeit better than the fiirst movie and the more recent Marvel movies. The fight scenes are awesome and the movie is not too heavy on the action. Spider-Man\\'s costume is given a major update. The humor is well-timed, and everyone didn\\'t become class clowns cracking jokes every 3 minutes like the new Marvel movies. Sam Raimi put his heart and soul into this movie, making sure it was just as good, if not better, than the first one. He wanted to make a film that casual audiences and Spider-Man fans will both love.My only issues are that Harry Osborn\\'s dialogue at one or two parts of the movie feel a bit forced and cartoonish, and that Mary Jane constantly latching on to somebody just because they\\'re with her at the moment & later she moves to another person is something that I just disliked about Kirsten Dunst\\'s Mary Jane. She was a better person in the comics than portrayed here. Other than that, it\\'s great. Spider-Man, J. Jonah Jameson, Mr. Ditkovich and his daughter, Dr. Octopus, Aunt May, Mary Jane Watson, Harry Osborn, Betty Brant, Joe Robertson, they\\'re all great. This is one of the best Marvel movies ever, and it\\'s way better than the new cringe-fest humor Marvel movies.. Pizza Time.. There is a 75 character minimum for reviews.

I didn\\'t watch this in theatres when it was released, but when I saw it on the telly years later, I was astounded. It was definitely better than the first one.   The first one did an amazing job at introducing who and what Spider-Man is. Spider-Man 2 lets its fans and audiences delve deeper into his character.   This  is considered to be the best out of Raimi\\'s trilogy. And it stands firm to this day.   Spider-Man 2 is a blast from the past if one were to experience again. But boy, does it get better. Every time.   A treasure I will always be proud to keep.  What was your favourite moment in the film?. Tobey easily plays an amazing Spider-Man/ Peter Parker and this movie took that and made it much better. The emotion in this was hecka good, the acting was good, the action seemed outdated but still hype energy, and the dang webs shoot out his wrists completely natural webs unlike the other movie Spider-Mans who uses a silly string can to shoot webs. Doc octopus was a great villain n this movie he definitely killed it.. Spider-Man 2 17 years later is still without a doubt one of the best comic book movies ever made.. Still a masterpiece from Sam Raimi, and ho,dis up very very well by today’s standards.. Imo this is still the best Marvel movie ever made. And the second best superhero movie ever made right up there with TDK.. Spider-Man 2 is just a very solid film overall. The script and story are all very good, as the characters are very well fleshed out, and the main character Peter Parker is very well developed and very relatable. The villain Doctor Octopus was also a great villain and has a great story arc in this movie that can teach audiences great themes. The directing is on point and highly competent. The acting from everyone is great, as just about everyone puts in a great performance with the standouts being, Tobey, Alfred, and JK Simmons. The action in this movie is all very well shot with great cinematography and was very fast-paced and intense. Just like the first one Danny Elfmans score is perfect for conveying the emotions needed in this movie. The editing is also rock solid, and even the pacing is good as the story is very focused and moved on from point to point without feeling like it is dragging.. Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. I grew up watching the movies and some of its TV series. The Spider-Man trilogy was what I watched before entering kindergarten. I’m 17 years old right now and I can’t believe how quickly time flies. I can’t believe it’s almost been 16 years since the release of Spider-Man 2. I’ve watched this movie more than 25 times. Whenever I watch it, there is not a single scene where I’ll go on my phone. The movie has everything I’m looking for! Action, romance, story, and friendship. Let’s get to the pros and cons!CONS:-What happened to that apartment Peter and Harry shared in Spider-Man 1.-Why and how did Peter become interested in delivering Pizzas.-Why did Peter just let the Pizza buyer get all the pizzas for free despite waiting too long. He should’ve taken that back or at least called Mr. Aziz. Nothing is free in America, lol.-Why did Peter just leave after Dock Ock drowned his experiment. Spidey should’ve gone back around the area to find Dock. He was still a good guy! He sacrificed himself to save the city.(I don’t know if those were cons lol. I guess these are just my questions for the movie.)PROS:-Tobey Maguire gives us another outstanding performance as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Truly the best spiderman we’ve ever had. -We got to see how hard it was for Peter to balance his two lives: Peter Parker’s and Spider-Man’s.-Perfect cast.-Music.-Action.-Plot/story/script-Everything was great in the movie.In the end, this movie did an unbelievable job to capture the audience’s attention. Perfect movie in all phases.. Masterpiece!. The perfect superhero movie, everything holds up to this day, the plot is beautiful and gripping, the characters are well-layered and complex, and the score, cinematography, and action are at its finest.. In the saga of Spiderman films with Tobey Maguire as New York\\'s favorite web-slinging hero, this is the best it beats Spiderman and Spiderman 3 even though those are great. If you have time, I suggest you watch this out of all the Tobey Maguire spiderman films as it\\'s the best. The acting is great, the visuals are good as usual and it has an amazing storyline.. This is one of my favorite superhero movie ever, but that doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s a bad movie, I would say that this movie is extremely well done, it makes peter parker more relatable and this movie is extremely well written, Alfred Molina has to be the greatest casting choice they\\'ve ever made cause he is so good as doc ock and the visuals hold up so well. 5/5. The trend of amazing Spider-Man movies continues with a sequel. The 2nd movie is just as good as the 1st. I love Doc Ock a little more than the Green Goblin. Peter doesn\\'t have as good of a connection to this villain as much as the first one, primarily because he didn\\'t know who Doc Ock was that much until he became a villain. He did go the farthest to destroying New York. He built a machine that was near impossible to defeat, and then got stopped the first time just by pulling the plug. The second time was a lot harder because it had to be pulled into the river. I loved the train fight scene when Peter had to stop the train from crashing off the end of the tracks after Doc Ock accelerated it to a higher speed. He thankfully stopped it at the last moment. I also loved how Doc Ock got the robot arms that pretty much made him a cyborg. He was originally a nice guy that seemed to obsessed with machines, but let his instincts take over. Harry even made a deal with him about powering the second machine, and he discovers the his best friend is Spider-Man, the guy he suspects killed his father. This movie is about the same as the first one to me, but still amazing, so go watch if you haven\\'t!. Spider-Man 2 is not only better then the first, but it is a strong contender for one of the best comic book movies ever made.. Omg this movie still holds up very very well. And is still one if the greatest comic book voice ever made.. When I watched this movie for the first time I thought it was okay as it was kinda boring. But watching it now the movie has aged very well and is better then I remember.. Movie still holds up very well. Imo both Spider-Man 1 and 2 are just as good as each other, as both are masterpieces in the superhero genre.. Most overrated superhero movie in existence. It was just as bad the first one.. Even after 17 years later Spider-Man 2 is still one of the greatest comic book movies ever made.. 2nd best Spider-Man movie ever!. Spider-Man 2 is still a very good movie, even after like almost 18 years it still holds up very well.. After the release of ITVS, and NWH this movie has kinda been dethrone as the best Spider-Man movie. But still this movie was amazing.. Most overrated superhero movie ever. It was just as bad as the first one.. Spider-Man 2 still to this day holds up very well. And is easily one of the greatest comic book movies ever made.. Man even after almost 17 years the movie holds up a okay.. 2nd best Spider-Man movie.. Great movie! It deserves a 11/10. It was just that good and it was a masterpiece.. A great movie with great writing. This was just a glorious masterpiece that was made by a Sam Raimi.. What a amazing movie this was. Will rewatch this movie again in about 2 days.. Spider-Man 2 stands the test of time. one of the sequels ever made and one of the best comic book movies ever made. the best spider- man movie ever made until NWH.. The movie still holds up extremely well even after almost 20 years. Great movie by Sam Raimi.. Tobey easily plays an amazing Spider-Man/ Peter Parker and this movie took that and made it much better. The emotion in this was hecka good, the acting was good, the action seemed outdated but still hype energy, and the dang webs shoot out his wrists completely natural webs unlike the other movie Spider-Mans who uses a silly string can shoot webs. Doc octopus was a great villain n this movie he definitely killed it.. A sequel that is just as good as the first movie, if not better.\\u2028The fight scene on the train is without a doubt one of the best action sequences ever made. \\u2028Alfred Molina’s Doc Ock is simply sublime: his backstory makes him one of the best villains and his wit makes him one of the most likeable. \\u2028Loved the Dr. Strange reference, I had never noticed until today but then again I haven’t watched this film in a few years!. So good! A masterpiece!. There is a 75 character minimum for reviews. If your review contains spoilers, please check the Spoiler box. Please do not use ALL CAPS.

The storytelling is perfect and very well executed. The characters are very entertaining and each one has a very understandable reason for their actions. This is probably the best superhero movie I\\'ve ever seen and it\\'s also one of the best movies I\\'ve ever seen. Honestly, I think this is better than The Dark Knight. Strongly recommend this to people who love Marvel and Superhero Movies in general.. To this day, this is still considered to be a great follow-up to Spider-Man (2002), one factor being that this movie had better material to exploit than the first one.Tobey Maguire is still a good Spider-Man.Alfred Molina was an excellent choice to play Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus.The one-issue comic, \"Spider-Man No More!\" was used as the main inspiration for the film with the emotional, iconic moment of Peter Parker throwing his Spider-Man suit into a trash can and walking away.Epic action scenes, such as the hospital scene where Otto\\'s Arms kill all of the surgeons in the operating theater, showing how dangerous they\\'ve become without the inhibitor chip suppressing them.Incredible visual effects on Doc Ock\\'s mechanical tentacles. In some scenes, they\\'re real mechanical arms that they created, and in other scenes they\\'re puppets.Funny cameo appearance by Bruce Campbell as the theater usher.The scene where Peter tells his Aunt May the truth about Uncle Ben\\'s death.Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus\\'s fight on top of a speeding train is action-packed and became an iconic moment in film.Much improved visual effects and cinematography from the first film.The Punisher makes a cameo appearance (Although it\\'s a blink or you\\'ll miss it type of cameo). Speaking of references to other Marvel characters, Doctor Strange is briefly name-dropped by Jameson.Amazing score composed by the legendary Danny Elfman, who also composed the score for the first film.The acting is great. Especially from Tobey Maguire went it comes to the emotional moments.\"Pizza time.\". Fourth best movie of all time!. A sequel that is just as good as the first movie, if not better.\\u2028The fight scene on the train is without a doubt one of the best action sequences ever made. \\u2028Alfred Molina’s Doc Ock is simply sublime: his backstory makes him one of the best villains and his wit makes him one of the most likeable. \\u2028Loved the Dr. Strange reference, I had never noticed until today but then again I haven’t watched this film in a few years!. This movie is a work of art. Not only does it show the day to day life of Peter Parker, it shows the many struggles of being Spider-Man. The villains are phenomenal, and the story is amazing. 10/10.. I rewatched this after years and I appreciate this movie so much more. The most faithful comic adaptation I’ve ever seen.. This is still the best Spider-Man movie to date. So emotional and told a great story.. I\\'ve seen this 2004 films about several times and it\\'s absolutely amazing! The acting is wonderful especially from Tobey Maguire. I remember seeing this at the Ormonde (then UCI, now Odeon Stillorgan) with my school in summer 2004 and I was 14 in that year. I thought it was brilliant. I still have it on DVD and I got it for Christmas in 2004.It\\'s probably one of the best sequels/2000s films of all time.. There is a 75 character minimum for reviews.

Amazing movie, just honestly cannot tell how much it works for the Spider-Man character. The sequel here shows us how Peter as the high school boy is still in financial problems with his life & has to do the challenge of balancing between being a student, working part time to make needs happen & then even turn into Spider-Man to catch the crooks who\\'re creating problems as usual. It\\'s catches up to him & he finds it very difficult to balance out these things coz if he isn\\'t working within time like the Joe\\'s Pizza in this movie, he\\'s fired or if he isn\\'t Spider-Man people die in the other end. It\\'s.just crazy how Sam Raimi who himself is a comic book fan & loves Spider-Man do such honor to our favourite friendly neighborhood hero & he fleshes him out possibly the best we\\'ve ever seen in an adaptation the Spider-Man character ever..

Spider-Man 2002 was a masterpiece, but this was way better then the first. Definitely deserves the amount of praise it is getting.. Track Track Track Track Track Track Track Track Track Track Track Track Track Track Track Track. Best Spider-Man movie ever! It showed a kid with struggles and is a very relatable person.. Spider-Man 2 is the peak of the classic styled superhero film that started in 1978 with Superman: The Movie. Sam Raimi\\'s second shot at the wall crawling hero does what all great sequels do by expanding upon its predecessors strengths. Funny, exciting, and featuring one of the more memorable super villains in any superhero film with Alfred Molina\\'s Doctor Octopus, Spider-Man 2 is first-rate entertainment.. There is only one Spiderman movie which is better. That is Spiderman: Into the Spider verse. This is by far my favourite Spider-man Movie of all time.I love what they do with Peter Parker losing his powers after carrying a lot of stress over his shoulders in his life. Otto Octavius is an excellent anti-villain, and I like how they make him a goofball in this movie. Great CGI, Great Scenes and Visuals, and I love the montage of Peter Parker living a normal life.I like how they make \"choice\" in this movie\\'s overall theme. If there\\'s anything I don\\'t like, it\\'s Kirsten Dunst\\'s Mary Jane.. a film that is close to me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. This movie is nothing more than a masterpiece, Super-Hero movies at it\\'s peak.When the first movie is about Peter learning what \"Responsability\" is and what is his, the second is about him coming to terms with the weight of it.It\\'s obvious in the movie in many different scenes that Spider-Man isn\\'t something positive on Peter\\'s life, on the contrary, it\\'s a big negative. He loses his job, fails at school, loses his friend and the love of his life all because of Spider-Man. What makes this even beautiful is that Peter isn\\'t the perfect kid, he struggles to be Spidey to the point of questioning the vows he made for Uncle Ben.We see that his life is indeed better and easier due to the lack of responsability, due to him walking away from it. In the amazing Burning Building scene, Peter has to save a child once again, but with no powers.Be it with the suit or without it, he still knows what\\'s right and is willing to risk his life for it. But he doesn\\'t do it alone, the victim herself has to (literally) lift him up and once again, he faces the consequences: an old man was in the building and didn\\'t survive the fire.Overcome with guilt, he meets Aunt May and confess what he did, how Uncle Ben died. It\\'s raw, it\\'s hard to watch and heartbreaking. You feel how disappointed this mother is in her son. And then, the \"Hero\" speech.There is no doubt she knew who Spider-Man was, when did she know? It doesn\\'t matter, what does matter is that she\\'s here for her son to teach him what it means to be heroic. It isn\\'t about saving people just for the sake of it, nor rescuing kids for the fame; it\\'s about doing the right thing even if that isn\\'t the best thing for you. This is what Spider-Man is about: a kid who struggles, who suffers with his responsabilities (even get to the point of denying it) but manages to do what\\'s right just because it is the right thing to do.Doc Ock is also an outstanding villain, Mary Jane continues to be a really deep character is these movies and Harry continues to be the rival for Peter. The SoundTrack is peak Spider-Man and the action-scenes are jaw-dropping and visceral. Definetly the best movie about the Web-head and one of the best hero movies of all time.. Many hail this film as one of the best superhero films ever made. While I don\\'t necessarily agree, I still think this is one of the better Spider-Man films. Once again, Tobey Maguire\\'s performance as the web-head is rock solid! He\\'s at the peek of his career as Spider-Man, especially during the famous runaway train scene. The CGI is a bit better and characters like MJ and Harry feel much more interesting than before. But as was with Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina steals the show as Dr. Octopus! While he isn\\'t as crazy as the Green Goblin, Otto Octavius is still a very threatening villain and a solid rival to Peter. The audience can also feel bad for Otto because of how his mechanical arms took control of him. This movie also implements the \"Spider Man No More\" story into the plot pretty well. Overall, while not an amazing film by any means, Spider Man 2 is the best in the trilogy and a solid film all around!. This is my all time favorite Spider-Man movie. It has an amazing story from beginning to end, all characters are incredibly relatable in some way or another, and the ending is the cherry on top of the cake. Great movie.. La película es buena, mejores en muchos aspectos a comparada de la primer película de Spider Man de Tobey Maguire.Con una trama interesante, que te puede enganchar y disfrutar, aparte la interpretación de Spider Man, es muy buena aparte de que aquí, se muestra la moral al 100% de Peter Parker, con la decisión de pensar, que el poder que conlleva Spider Man, no lo puede manejar mostrando que seria mejor, que dejara de serlo, pero después se muestra que necesita serlo para proteger y que le den esperanzas de que hay alguien que los protejan, el día a día, dando una moraleja.El uso de las músicas/Soundtracks son perfectas dando la sensación de que el espectador este ahí.Aparte el humor del personaje acompaña, y su villano es uno de los mejores que existen en el mundo de Spider Man, y la película a hecho momentos muy iconicos en la historia de las películasNo hay que olvidarnos que es la mejor Película de Spider Man jamas hecha y una de las mejores películas que existen en toda su historia. Rozando la perfección, lo único que en mi opinión lo deja cerca de la perfección, es que hay escenas que son alargadas innecesariamente y algunas relleno.Calificación Final: 9.8. When a movie has a **** ton of meme templates, you know it is a very good movie.. Fantasic great villian great plot great film great cast funny good designs every wanted in a spiderman film. The greatest marvel superhero movie. Tobey Maguire is awesome in this movie, plot one of the best sides of this masterpiece.. Marvel\\'s best superhero movie in as long as I can remember. For fans of the genre, a pure orgasm lasting just over two hours.'"
